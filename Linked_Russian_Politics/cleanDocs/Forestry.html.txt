Forestry in Russia 
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search 
The timber industry is a significant contributor to the economy of Russia, worth around 20 billion dollars per year.
Russia has more than a fifth of the world's forests, which makes it the largest forest country in the world. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] However, according to a 2012 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Government of the Russian Federation, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] the considerable potential of Russian forests is underutilized and Russia's share of the global trade in forest products is less than four percent. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] 
There are significant profits to be made selling timber to China in particular, and there have been allegations of illegal logging within Russia.
On 2007-12-06, Oleg Zhukovsky, a senior manager at VTB Bank working with the Russian timber industry, was found dead in the empty swimming pool of his dacha outside Moscow. Links to the criminal gangs within the Russian timber industry are suspected, and a murder investigation is underway. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
