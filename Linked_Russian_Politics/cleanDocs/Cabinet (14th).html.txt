Among others, Medvedev's cabinet had to overcome the lowest growth of the economy since the 2008 Russian financial crisis. To do so, Medvedev offered specific measures including a strict control over tariff rises in coming years, the possible canceling of import duties on scientific equipment, regional tax holidays and a series of new measures implemented through the Central Bank for facilitating the appearance of long-term investment.
