District courts of Russia 
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Kanashsky District Court in Chuvashia. 
The district courts of Russia (Russian: NDDDDDND NND or DDNDDNDDD NND ; also called rayon or raion courts) are primarily courts of first instance in the judiciary of Russia but sometimes hear appeals from magistrates' courts. [ 1 ] They are formed in raion or areas ( NDDDDDN ), urban areas ( NDDDDDN D DDNDDDN ), and cities ( DDNDDDN ). Decisions of the court are appealed to the regional court.
As courts of first instance, they handle criminal cases where imprisonment is for more than 3 years, and consist of 1 judge and a jury where required. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] As courts of appeal from decisions of the magistrate courts consisting of 1 justice of the peace, they consist of 1 judge and retry the case. [ 1 ] 
They were called People's Courts until 1996. [ 1 ]
