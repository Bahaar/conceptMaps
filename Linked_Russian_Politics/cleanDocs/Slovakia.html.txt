History [ edit ] 
Before the 1989 revolution, Czechoslovakia was a socialist dictatorship ruled by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, technically together with the coalition of the so-called National Front. Before the free democratic elections could take place after the revolution, a transitional government was created. 1989 President of Czechoslovakia GustAv HusAk sworn in the Government of National Understanding (Czech: VlAda nArodnAho porozumAnA , Slovak: VlAda nArodnAho porozumenia ) headed by MariAn Aalfa and he himself abdicated. It consisted of 10 communists and 9 non-communists and its main goal was to prepare for democratic elections, to establish market economy in the country and to start preparing a new constitution.
On 8a9 June 1990, the Czechoslovakian parliamentary election of 1990 took place. Aalfa's second government was disbanded on 27 June 1990, when it was replaced by the Government of National Sacrifice (Czech: VlAda nArodnA obAti , Slovak: VlAda nArodnej obete ), also headed by MariAn Aalfa. On 5a6 June 1992, the last elections in Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovakian parliamentary election of 1992 took place. Aalfa's third government was disbanded on 2 July 1992, when it was replaced by the Caretaker Government of Jan StrAskA (Czech: VlAda Jana StrAskAho , Slovak: VlAda Jana StrAskAho ), headed by Jan StrAskA. The caretaker government was disbanded on 31 December 1992 together with the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic.
Due to federalism, immediately after the 1989 revolution, two national governments (one for the Czech Republic, one for Slovakia) were created as well under the federal Czechoslovak government. In Slovakia it was headed by Milan AiA and it was established on 12 December 1989 and disbanded on 26 June 1990. On 8a9 June 1990, the Slovak parliamentary election of 1990 took place together with the federal Czechoslovak elections. AiA's government was followed by the First Government of VladimAr MeAiar (1990-1991), Government of JAn AarnogurskA (1991-1992) and the Second Government of VladimAr MeAiar (1992-1994). On 5a6 June the Slovak parliamentary election of 1992 took place.
Legal system [ edit ] 
The Constitution of the Slovak Republic was ratified 1 September 1992 and became effective 1 October 1992 (some parts 1 January 1993). It was amended in September 1998 to allow direct election of the president and again in February 2001 due to EU admission requirements. The civil law system is based on Austro-Hungarian codes. The legal code was modified to comply with the obligations of Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and to expunge the MarxistaLeninist legal theory. Slovakia accepts the compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction with reservations.

The president is elected by direct, popular vote, under the two round system, for a five-year term.
Following National Council elections, the leader of the majority party or the leader of the majority coalition is usually appointed prime minister by the president. Cabinet appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister has to receive the majority in the parliament. From July 2006 till July 2010 the coalition consisted of Smer, SNS and HZDS. After the 2010 elections a coalition was formed by the former opposition parties SDKA, KDH and MostaHAd and newcomer SaS.
Legislative branch [ edit ] 
Slovakia's sole constitutional and legislative body is the 150-seat unicameral National Council of the Slovak Republic. Delegates are elected for 4-year terms on the basis of proportional representation.
The National Council considers and approves the Constitution, constitutional statutes and other legal acts. It also approves the state budget. It elects some officials specified by law as well as the candidates for the position of a Justice of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic and the Prosecutor General.

Moreover, it gives consent for dispatching of military forces outside of Slovakia's territory and for the presence of foreign military forces on the territory of the Slovak Republic.

Political parties : The Slovak political scene supports a wide spectrum of political parties including the communists (KSS) and the nationalists (SNS). New parties arise and old parties cease to exist or merge at a frequent rate. Major parties are members of the European political parties. Some parties have regional strongholds, for example SMK is supported mainly by the Hungarian minority living in southern Slovakia. Although the main political cleavage in the 1990s concerned the somewhat authoritarian policy of HZDS, the left-right conflict over economic reforms (principally between Direction - Social Democracy and Slovak Democratic and Christian Union - Democratic Party) has recently become the dominant power in Slovakia's politics.
Judicial branch [ edit ] 
The country's highest appellate forum is the Supreme Court ( NajvyAAA sAd ), the judges of which are elected by the National Council; below that are regional, district, and military courts. In certain cases the law provides for decisions of tribunals of judges to be attended by lay judges from the citizenry. Slovakia also has the Constitutional Court of Slovakia ( AstavnA sAd Slovenskej Republiky ), which rules on constitutional issues. The 13 members of this court are appointed by the president from a slate of candidates nominated by Parliament.
In 2002 Parliament passed legislation which created a Judicial Council. This 18-member council, composed of judges, law professors, and other legal experts, is now responsible for the nomination of judges. All judges except those of the Constitutional Court are appointed by the president from a list proposed by the Judicial Council. The Council also is responsible for appointing Disciplinary Senates in cases of judicial misconduct.
