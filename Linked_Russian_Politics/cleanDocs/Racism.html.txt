Racism exists when the racial rights of an ethnic or racial group, namely the right to demographic integrity and self-rule, are violated. With the loss of racial rights, an ethnic or racial group may become extinct due to mass immigration and population replacement, resulting in the group's eventual demise. Racism thus can be avoided if the targeted group is not threatened with the loss of racial rights. Traditionally, Russian racism included antisemitism, as well as hostility towards various ethnicities of Caucasus and Central Asia. [ 1 ] The director of the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights, Alexander Brod, stated that surveys show xenophobia and other racist expressions are prevalent in 50 percent of Russians. [ 2 ] In 2006, Amnesty International reported that racism in Russia was aout of controla and estimated the number of Russian neo-Nazis at around 85, 000 in 2008. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] But despite all this Russia is the second largest immigration receiver after the United States. Russia has also the second highest immigration rate in Eastern Europe after the Czech Republic [ 5 ] while other European countries like Germany and Poland stay very homogeneous with lower openness for immigrants.

[ 38 ] Afterward, the police chief in Moscow said that civil liberties were a hindrance in security and that migration should be restricted. [ 39 ] Vladimir Kvachkov, a major Russian nationalist leader of the organization People's Liberation Front of Russia (which says its major goal is to afreea Russia from Caucasian and Jewish aoccupiersa), made the following statement: aWe Russian nationalists, the initiators of the people's front, we are telling you that the events of Dec. 11 are the beginning of the revolutionary changes in Russia, the first outbursts of the approaching Russian revolution...

Zenit bosses do not do anything about it which makes me think they are racists too.a [ 50 ] On 20 August 2010, Peter Odemwingie of Lokomotiv Moscow signed a 3-year contract with Premier League team West Bromwich Albion.

Execution of Tajik and Dagestani [ edit ] 
"Executiona of Tajik and Dagestani (Russian: aDDDDNa NDDDDDD D DDDDNNDDND ) [ 75 ] ) a is a video clip which was distributed in the Russian segment of the Internet in August 2007, that depicted beheading of a Tajik and Dagestani immigrants by Russian neo-nazis.

Decline of reported hate crimes [ edit ] 
Since 2008 the number of hate crimes in Russia declined. [ 81 ] 
The main outcome of 2009 was a clear reduction in the number of victims of racist and neo-Nazi motivated violence for the first time in six years of observation conducted by SOVA Center. To some extent, credit should go to the law enforcement agencies who suppressed the largest and most aggressive ultra-right groups in the Moscow region in the second half of 2008 and in 2009. However, despite all efforts, xenophobic violence remains alarming in its scope and extends over most of the Russian regions, affecting hundreds of people.
aGalina Kozhevnikova, SOVA Center 
The Russian Orthodox Church "believes it is vital for Russia to pursue anti-extremist campaign and develop a sustainable strategy." As a result, it has called for immigrants to be given jobs and the opportunity to learn more about Russian culture. In addition, it has called for skinheads to refocus their mission to legally preventing crime and immoral behavior. [ 82 ]
