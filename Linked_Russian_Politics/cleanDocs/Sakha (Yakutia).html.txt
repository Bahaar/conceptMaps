It has a population of 958, 528 (2010 Census), [ 7 ] consisting mainly of ethnic Yakuts and Russians.
Comprising half of the Far Eastern Federal District, it is the largest subnational governing body by area in the world at 3, 083, 523 square kilometers (1, 190, 555sqmi) [ 6 ] and the eighth largest territory in the world, if the federal subjects of Russia were compared with other countries. It is larger than Argentina and just smaller than India which covers an area of 3, 287, 590 square kilometers (1, 269, 350sqmi). [ 6 ] Its capital is the city of Yakutsk. The Sakha Republic is one of the ten autonomous Turkic Republics within the Russian Federation. [ 12 ]

Geography [ edit ] 
Fauna of the Sakha Republic: the Ross's Gull, the Siberian crane, the polar bear, the horse, the reindeer. Russian post miniature sheet, 2006. Borders : internal : Chukotka Autonomous Okrug (660km)(E), Magadan Oblast (1520km)(E/SE), Khabarovsk Krai (2130km)(SE), Amur Oblast (S), Zabaykalsky Krai (S), Irkutsk Oblast (S/SW), Krasnoyarsk Krai (W)., water : Arctic Ocean (including Laptev Sea and Eastern Siberian Sea) (N)., . , Highest point : Peak Pobeda (3, 003m), Mus-Khaya Mountain Peak (2959m or 3, 011m), Maximum N->S distance : 2, 500km (1, 600mi), Maximum E->W distance : 2, 000km (1, 200mi), . 
Sakha stretches to the Henrietta Island in the far north and is washed by the Laptev and Eastern Siberian Seas of the Arctic Ocean. These waters, the coldest and iciest of all seas in the northern hemisphere, are covered by ice for 9a10months of the year. New Siberian Islands are a part of the republic's territory. After Nunavut was separated from Canada's Northwest Territories, Sakha became the largest subnational entity (statoid) in the world, with an area of 3, 083, 523 square kilometers (1, 190, 555sqmi), [ 6 ] slightly smaller than the territory of India (3.3million kmA).
Sakha can be divided into three great vegetation belts. About 40f Sakha lies above the Arctic circle and all of it is covered by permafrost which greatly influences the region's ecology and limits forests in the southern region. Arctic and subarctic tundra define the middle region, where lichen and moss grow as great green carpets and are favorite pastures for reindeer. In the southern part of the tundra belt, scattered stands of dwarf Siberian pine and larch grow along the rivers. Below the tundra is the vast taiga forest region. Larch trees dominate in the north and stands of fir and pine begin to appear in the south. Taiga forests cover about 47f Sakha and almost 90f the cover is larch.
The Sakha Republic is the site of Pleistocene Park, a project directed at recreating pleistocene tundra grasslands by stimulating the growth of grass with the introduction of animals which thrived in the region during the late Pleistocenea early Holocene period.
Time zones [ edit ] 
Map of Sakha (Yakutia) 
Sakha spans three different time zones (no Daylight Saving Time in summer):
Yakutsk Time Zone (YAKT, UTC+9). Covers the republic's territory to the west of the Lena River as well as the territories of the districts located on the both sides of the Lena River. , Vladivostok Time Zone (VLAT, UTC+10). Covers most of the republic's territory located between 127AE and 140AE longitude. Districts: Oymyakonsky, Ust-Yansky, Verkhoyansky. [ 13 ] , Srednekolymsk Time Zone (SRET, UTC+11). Covers most of the republic's territory located east of 140AE longitude. Districts: Abyysky, Allaikhovsky, Momsky, Nizhnekolymsky, Srednekolymsky, Verkhnekolymsky. This time zone name was introduced in 2014 when Magadan left the Magadan Time Zone [ 13 ] , Detailed map of the three timezones in the Sakha Republic (as of September 2011) 
Rivers [ edit ] 
Amga River 
Navigable Lena River (4, 310km), as it moves northward, includes hundreds of small tributaries located in the Verkhoyansk Range. Other major rivers include:
Vilyuy River (2, 650km) Lena River tributary, Olenyok River (2, 292km), Aldan River (2, 273km) Lena River tributary, Kolyma River (2, 129km), Indigirka River (1, 726km), Alazeya River (1, 590km), Amga River (1, 462km) Aldan River tributary, Olyokma River (1, 320km) Lena River tributary, Markha River (1, 181km) Vilyuy River tributary, Tyung River (1, 092km) Vilyuy River tributary, Maya River (1, 053km) Aldan River tributary, Anabar River (939km), Yana River (872km), Morkoka River (812km) Markha River tributary, Uchur River (812km) Aldan River tributary, Linde River (804km) Lena River tributary, Nyuya River (798km) Lena River tributary, Selennyakh River (796km) Indigirka River tributary, . 
Lakes [ edit ] 
There are over 800, 000lakes in the republic. [ 14 ] Major lakes and reservoirs include:
Lake Mogotoyevo, Lake Nedzheli, Lake Nerpichye, Vilyuyskoye Reservoir, . 
Mountains [ edit ] 
Sakha's greatest mountain range, the Verkhoyansk Range, runs parallel and east of the Lena River, forming a great arc that begins the Sea of Okhotsk and ends in the Laptev Sea.
The Chersky Range runs east of the Verkhoyansk Range and has the highest peak in Sakha, Peak Pobeda (3, 147m). The second highest peak is Peak Mus-Khaya reaching 3, 011m.
The Stanovoi Range borders Sakha in the south.

Natural resources [ edit ] 
Sakha is well endowed with raw materials. The soil contains large reserves of oil, gas, coal, diamonds, gold, silver, tin, tungsten and many others. Sakha produces 99f all Russian diamonds and over 25f the diamonds mined in the world. [ citation needed ] 
Climate [ edit ] 
Sakha is known for its climate extremes, with the Verkhoyansk Range being the coldest area in the northern hemisphere. Winters here are extremely cold. Some of the lowest natural temperatures ever recorded have been here. The Northern Hemisphere's Pole of Cold is at Verkhoyansk, where the temperatures reached as low as a67.8AC (a90.0AF) in 1892, and at Oymyakon, where the temperatures reached as low as a71.2AC (a96.2AF) in 1926.
Average January temperature : a28AC (a18AF) (coast) to a47AC (a53AF) (Pole of Cold)., Average July temperature : +2AC (36AF) (coast) to +19AC (66AF) (central parts). However, it gets very hot during the day in Yakutsk in July (record = +38.4AC (101.1AF))., Average annual precipitation : 200mm (central parts) to 700mm (mountains of Eastern Sakha)., .

Early history [ edit ] 
The Turkic Sakha people or Yakuts probably settled in the area in the 13th and 14th centuries, migrating north from the Lake Baikal area to the middle Lena. From their new center along the middle Lena they gradually expanded northeast and west beyond the Lena basin towards the Arctic Ocean.
The name Sakha is of Turkic origin, "Saqa-Saha" meaning "Cue, Bat". The term Yakut is a Turkic word, a corruption of zhaqut - yakut "precious stone", referring to the Ruby. The Sakha displaced earlier, much smaller populations who lived on hunting and reindeer herding, introducing the pastoralist economy of Central Asia. The indigenous populations of Paleosiberian and Tungusic stock were mostly assimilated to the Sakha by the 17th century. [ 15 ] 
Russian conquest [ edit ] 
Main article: Russian conquest of Siberia 
The Tsardom of Russia began its conquest of the region in the 17th century, moving east after the defeat of the Khanate of Sibir. Tygyn, a king of the Khangalassky Yakuts, granted territory for Russian settlement in return for a military pact that included war against indigenous rebels of all North Eastern Asia (Magadan, Chukotka, Kamchatka and Sakhalin). Kull, a king of the Megino-Khangalassky Yakuts, began a Sakha conspiracy by allowing the first stockade construction. [ citation needed ] 
In August 1638, the Moscow Government formed a new administrative unit with the administrative center of Lensky Ostrog (Fort Lensky), the future city of Yakutsk, which had been founded by Pyotr Beketov in 1632.
The arrival of the Russian settlers at the remote Russkoye Ustye in the Indigirka delta likely also dates to the 17th century. [ 16 ] The Siberian Governorate was established as part of the Russian Tsardom in 1708.
Russian settlers began to form a community in the 18th century, which adopted certain Yakut customs and was often called Yakutyane (DDNNNIDD) or Lena Early Settlers (DDDNDDD NNDNDDDDN). However, the influx of later settlers assimilated them into the Russian mainstream by the 20th century.
Russian Empire [ edit ] 
1821 map of Yakutsk Oblast 
In an administrative reform of 1782, Irkutsk Governorate was created. In 1805, Yakutsk Oblast was split from Irkutsk Governorate.
Yakutsk Oblast in the early 19th century marked the easternmost territory of the Russian Empire, including such Far Eastern (Pacific) territories as were acquired, known as Okhotsk Okrug within Yakutsk Oblast. With the formation of Primorskaya Oblast in 1856, the Russian territories of the Pacific were detached from Yakutia.
The Russians established agriculture in the Lena River basin. The members of religious groups who were exiled to Sakha in the second half of the 19th century began to grow wheat, oats, and potatoes. The fur trade established a cash economy. Industry and transport began to develop at the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the Soviet period. This was also the beginning of geological prospecting, mining, and local lead production. The first steam-powered ships and barges arrived.
Yakutia's remoteness, even compared to the rest of Siberia, made it a place of exile of choice for both Czarist and Communist governments of Russia. Among the famous Tsarist-era exiles were the democratic writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Doukhobor conscientious objectors (whose story was told to Leo Tolstoy by Vasily Pozdnyakov), the Socialist Revolutionary and writer Vladimir Zenzinov, who left an interesting account of his Arctic experiences, and Polish socialist activist WacAaw Sieroszewski who pioneered in ethnographic research on Yakut people.
Soviet era [ edit ] 
On April27, 1922, former Yakutsk Oblast was proclaimed the Yakut ASSR, although in fact the eastern part of the territory, including the city of Yakutsk, was controlled by the White Russians (see Yakut Revolt).
In 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Yakutia was recognized in Moscow as the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. Yakutia is historically part of Russian Siberia, but since the formation of the Far Eastern Federal District in 2000, it is administratively part of the Russian Far East.

The official languages are both Russian and Sakha, also known as Yakut, which is spoken by approximately 40f the population. The Yakut language is a member of the Turkic language family.
Religion [ edit ] 
Religion in Yakutia (2012) [ 20 ] [ 21 ] 
Russian Orthodox (37.8/div> Tengrist or Yakut shaman (13/div> Muslim (2/div> Unaffiliated Christian (1/div> Protestant (1/div> Buddhist (0.4/div> Atheist (26/div> Spiritual but not religious (17/div> Other or undeclared (1.8/div> 
Before the arrival of the Russian Empire, the majority of the local population believed in Tengrianism common to Turkic-language people of Central Asia, or in Paleoasian indigenous shamanism with both 'light' (community leading) and 'dark' (healing through spirit journey) shamans. Under the Russians, the local population was converted to the Russian Orthodox Church and required to take Orthodox Christian names, but in practice generally continued to follow traditional religions. During the Soviet era, most or all of the shamans died without successors.
In the 1990s, a neopagan shamanist movement called aiyy yeurekhA was founded by the controversial journalist Ivan Ukhkhan and a philologist calling himself TAris. [ 22 ] This group and others cooperated to build a shaman temple in downtown Yakutsk in 2002. [ 23 ] 
Currently, while Orthodox Christianity maintains a following (however, with very few priests willing to be stationed outside of Yakutsk), there is interest and activity toward renewing the traditional religions. As of 2008, Orthodox leaders described the world view of the republic's indigenous population (or, rather, those among the population who are not completely indifferent to religion) as dvoyeverie (dual belief system), or a "tendency toward syncretism", as evidenced by the locals sometimes first inviting a shaman, and then an Orthodox priest to carry out their rites in connection with some event in their life. [ 24 ] 
According to the Information Center under the President of Sakha Republic (DDNDNDDNDDDDND NDDNN DND DNDDDDDDND DD(D)), the religious demography of the republic was as follows: [ 25 ] Orthodoxy: 44.9shamanism: 26.2non-religious: 23.0new religious movements: 2.4Islam: 1.2Buddhism: 1.0Protestantism: 0.9Catholicism: 0.4/p> 
According to a 2012 official survey [ 20 ] 37.8f the population of Yakutia adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 1re unaffiliated generic Christians, 13f the population adheres to Tengrism or Yakut shamanism, 2o Islam, 1o forms of Protestantism, and 0.4o Tibetan Buddhism. In addition, 17f the population deems itself to be "spiritual but not religious", 26s atheist, and 1.8ollows other religions or did not give an answer to the question. [ 20 ] 
Politics [ edit ] 
The head of government in Sakha is the Head (previously President). The first Head of the Sakha Republic was Mikhail Yefimovich Nikolayev. [ 26 ] As of 2010, the president is Yegor Borisov, who took office on May 31, 2010; his vice president is Evgeniya Mikhailova.
The supreme legislative body of state authority in Sakha is a unicameral State Assembly known as the Il Tumen . The government of the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic is the executive body of state authority.
The republic fosters close cultural, political, economic, and industrial relations with the independent Turkic states through membership in organizations such as the Turkic Council and the Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] 
Economy [ edit ]

Industrial enterprises are concentrated in the capital Yakutsk, as well as in Aldan, Mirny, Neryungri, Pokrovsk, and Udachny. The diamond, gold and tin ore mining industries are the major focus of the economy. Uranium ore is beginning to be mined. Turkic-language Sakha are in politics, government, finance, economy and cattle-breeding (horses and cows for milk and meat). The Paleoasian indigenous peoples are hunters, fishermen, and reindeer herders. As of 2008, Sakha Republic is the 19th most developed federal subject in Russia.
Transportation [ edit ] 
Water transport ranks first for cargo turnover. There are six river ports, two sea ports (Tiksi and Zelyony Mys). Four shipping companies, including the Arctic Sea Shipping Company , operate in the republic. The republic's main waterway is the Lena River, which links Yakutsk with the rail station of Ust-Kut in Irkutsk Oblast.
Air transport is the most important for transporting people. Airlines connect the republic with most regions of Russia. Yakutsk Airport has an international terminal.
Two federal roads pass the republic. They are YakutskaSkovorodino (M56 Lena highway) and YakutskaMagadan (M56 Kolyma Highway). However, due to the presence of permafrost, use of asphalt is not practical, and therefore the roads are made of clay. When heavy rains blow over the region, the roads often turn to mud, sometimes stranding hundreds of travellers in the process. [ 30 ] 
The BerkakitaTommot railroad is currently in operation. It links the Baikal Amur Mainline with the industrial centers in South Yakutia. Construction of the Amur Yakutsk Mainline continues northward; the railway was completed to Nizhny Bestyakh, across the river from Yakutsk, in 2013.
Education [ edit ] 
The most important facilities of higher education include North-Eastern Federal University (previously Yakutsk State University) and Yakutsk State Agricultural Academy.
Culture [ edit ] 
The cultural life of Yakutsk is constantly developing. There are many places worth visiting.
These include: the State Russian drama theatre named after A. S. Pushkin; the Sakha Theater named after P. A. Oiyunsky; the State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre named after D. K. Sivtsev; and Suorun Omoloon, Young Spectator's Theatre.
There are a number of interesting museums as well. These include the National Fine Arts Museum of Sakha, the Museum of Local Lore and History named after E. Yaroslavsky, and the Khomus Museum and Museum of Permafrost.
