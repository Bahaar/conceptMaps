Offices of the Presidential Administration, an Art Nouveau building in Staraya Square. 
On 25 March 2004, Vladimir Putin undertook a major reorganisation of this institution by a decree (Full text in Russian: [ 2 ] ). Only two deputy chiefs remained out of seven. The Press Office and the Information Office were merged into the Press and Information Office, the Pardon Directorate and the Citizenship Directorate were merged into the Directorate for Protecting Citizens' Constitutional Rights. The Personnel Directorate and the State Decorations Directorate were merged into the Personnel and State Decorations Directorate, the Protocol Directorate and the Organisation Directorate were merged into the Protocol and Organization Directorate. The Territorial Directorate was included in the Domestic policy Directorate. The Economic Directorate was abolished, the Civil Service Directorate was created.
Presidential Envoys to Federal districts of Russia [ edit ] 
Main article: Federal districts of Russia 
The federal districts of Russia are a level of administration for the convenience of the federal government. They are not the constituent units of Russia (which are the federal subjects). Each district includes several federal subjects and each federal district has a presidential envoy (whose official title is Plenipotentiary Representative). The official task of the Plenipotentiary Representative is simply to oversee the work of federal agencies in the regions, although in practice this oversight is extensive and of considerable consequence. Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws.
This institution was organised in 2000.
