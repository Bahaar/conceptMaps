(May 2009) , The transport network of the Russian Federation is one of the world's most extensive. The national web of roads, railways and airways stretches almost 4, 800 miles (7, 700km) from Kaliningrad in the west to the Kamchatka Peninsula in the east, and major cities such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg are served by extensive rapid transit systems.
Russia has adopted two national transport strategies in recent years. On 12 May 2005, the Russian Ministry of Transport adopted the Transport Strategy of the Russian Federation to 2020. Three years later, on 22 November 2008, the Russian government adopted a revised strategy, extending to 2030.
The export of transport services is an important component of Russiaas GDP. The government anticipates that between 2007 and 2030, the measures included in its 2008 transport strategy will increase the export of transport services to a total value of $80 billion, a sevenfold increase on its 2008 value. Foreign cargo weight transported is expected to increase from 28 million tonnes to 100 million tonnes over the same period.

Russia has the world's second-largest railway network, second only to that of the United States, [ 1 ] with a total track length of 87, 157 kilometres (54, 157mi) as of 2011. Of this, 86, 200 kilometres (53, 600mi) uses a broad rail gauge of 1, 520mm ( 4ft 11 27 a 32 in ), while a narrow gauge of 1, 067mm ( 3ft6in ) is used on a 957-km (595-mile) stretch of railway on Sakhalin Island. Electrified track accounts for around half of the Russian railway network - totalling 40, 300 kilometres (25, 000mi) - but carries the majority of railway traffic. [ 2 ]

Russian Railways, the state-owned national rail carrier, is one of the world's largest transport companies, enjoying a monopoly over rail transport in Russia. Established in 1992, it employs an estimated 950, 000 people, and accounted for 2.5f the entire national GDP in 2009. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] In 2007 alone, Russian Railways carried a total of 1.3 billion passengers [ 5 ] and 1.3 billion tons of freight [ 6 ] on its common-carrier routes.

As of 2006 Russia had 933, 000km of roads, of which 755, 000 were paved. [ 7 ] Some of these make up the Russian federal motorway system.

Road safety in Russia is poor with road accident deaths per million population higher than all countries in the G8 and the other BRIC countries. When assessing the level of risk when travelling on Russia's roads (i.e. the number of accidents per unit of travel) it is 60 times that of Great Britain. [ 8 ] With a large land area the road density is the lowest of all the G8 and BRIC countries. [ 8 ] Dashcams are widespread, inasmuch as Russian courts prefer video evidence to eyewitness testimony, but also as a guard against police corruption and insurance fraud. [ 9 ]

During Soviet times, since 1945 the import of cars to a halt, with the onset of the free car sales Soviet production. But at the same time brought into the fairly large number of trucks and buses, mainly because of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe (e.g. urban, intercity and tourist buses Ikarus, buses and trucks Skoda, trucks Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde, Robur, Tatra, LIAZ, Praga V3S, Csepel, Avia, ZSD Nysa passenger vans, Zuk cargo vans). At the same time they are imported and from the capitalist countries (OAF trucks in the late 50s, tractors Volvo and Mercedes-Benz NG in 1970-1980 for Sovtransavto, organization engaged in international road transport, the party tractors Unic-Fiat in the middle 1970s for the Leningrad port, dump trucks Unit Rig in 1979-1983, dump trucks International Harvester Paystar and concrete mixers on their base for the construction of irrigation canals, dump trucks Berliet T60 in 1969 to open the mine and ore processing plant of Ai in the Orenburg Oblast, ballast tractors Fawn in 1970-1980's, dump trucks Komatsu since 1979; bonneted flatbed trucks and dump trucks Magirus, since 1975 for the construction of BaikalaAmur Mainline (BAM)).
By the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow was given the party cars Mercedes-Benz S-Class W116 to work as police cars and taxis for tourists, as well as on the basis of reanimation vans of the same brand.
Nevertheless, the leading place in the transportation within the country occupied by Soviet-made cars (passenger cars Moskvitch, GAZ-M20 Pobeda, GAZ, ZiL, VAZ, Izh, ZAZ, jeeps UAZ, LuAZ, vans RAF, ErAZ, trucks GAZ, Kamaz, ZiL, MAZ, KrAZ, UralAZ, BelAZ, KAZ (Colkhides), buses KAvZ, PAZ, LiAZ, LAZ, trolleybuses ZiU).
In 1988, together with the resolution of business, was allowed free sale of trucks and buses.
Since the 1990s, there was a massive import of cars, second-hand first, and then the new.
In the 2000s, foreign companies began to massively build factories in Russia, or to enter into agreements with existing assembly plants.
Currently, the European and Asian parts of Russia as different fleet. In the European part of the new cars mostly Russian, European, Japanese, American, Chinese; on the Asian side are mainly used Japanese cars, it is often a model for the Japanese domestic market (the largest proportion in Vladivostok).
The largest share of Russian car brands in the North Caucasus (e.g. Dagestan and Chechnya).
The same attitude on the trucks. Recently, European and Chinese trucks brands in the Russian pushed long haul, although the position of Russian in the short and middle transport remain.
Park marshrutkas (fixed-route taxi) are vehicles of the Russian model GAZelle, as well as minibuses, converted from cargo vans of European brands (Ford Transit, Peugeot Boxer, Fiat Ducato, Renault Master, Iveco Daily, Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, Volkswagen Crafter) on special Russian companies that are licensed by the manufacturer. Also operate small buses Russian (PAZ, BAW), Ukrainian (Bogdan, South Korean (Hyundai County) and Chinese brands. Usually owned by a limited liability company or individual entrepreneurs, while in Moscow, along with private and state also exist, painted in a single color.
City buses, mainly Russian brands (PAZ, KAvZ, LiAZ, MARZ, NefAZ, Volzhanin) and Belarusian MAZ. Buses European production is in Vladivostok (51 buses MAN A78 Lion's City LE, Moscow (1 bus Mercedes-Benz Turk O345 Connecto LF, 4 buses Ikarus 435, 71 buses Scania OmniLink of Russian assembly, 1 bus MAN A23 Lion's City GL, Kolomna (16 buses Mercedes-Benz Turk O345 Connecto H, 1 bus Mercedes-Benz TArk O345 Conecto LF), St. Petersburg (16 buses MAN Lion's Classic, 52 buses Scania OmniLink). In other cities also work used German, Swedish, Finnish, Dutch coaches production of 80a90 years and the new Chinese. The most successful enterprises of public transport in Moscow, Kolomna, St. Petersburg, Sochi and Kazan (which in 2007 was held the most successful reform of the bus transport with a full upgrade of the park, the prohibition of exploitation in the city). In July 2014 the Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev issued a decree banning purchases of foreign techics (included public transport)for state and municipal needs.
Intercity buses Chinese, Korean and Russian brands. At the same time, large companies for their service needs are buying European buses.
Became popular gray import, which involved special dealers. Basically entered cars or American brands for the USA market (such as Ford Mustang, Lincoln Town Car, Ford F-Series, Dodge Viper, Toyota Sienna, Toyota 4Runner). Sometimes, after analyzing these sales by manufacturers begin official sales (so began selling cars Acura, Toyota Highlander, Toyota Venza, Infiniti, Chevrolet Corvette, Chevrolet Camaro).
In the same way the American imported trucks (mainly long-range tractors) that despite this popular in Russia. In Russia reach trucks from brands like Freightliner, International, Peterbuilt and Volvo models for United States market. In late 2013 International he started his own office and started formal sale of the tractor International ProStar in a special version for Russia. In 2014, due to begin official sales of dump trucks Western Star 6900XD.
