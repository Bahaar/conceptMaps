, v , t , e , . , The rights and liberties of the citizens of the Russian Federation are granted by Chapter 2 of the Constitution adopted in 1993. [ 1 ] 
Russia is the signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has also ratified a number of other international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (fully) and the European Convention of Human Rights (with reservations). These international law instruments take precedence over national legislation according to Chapter 1, Article 15 of the Constitution. [ 1 ] 
As a member of the Council of Europe Russia has international obligations related to the issue of human rights. [ citation needed ] In the introduction to the 2004 report on the situation in Russia, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, noted the "sweeping changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union" and reported that "the fledgling Russian democracy is still, of course, far from perfect, but its existence and its successes cannot be denied." [ 2 ] 
In recent years Vladimir Lukin, current Ombudsman of the Russian Federation, has invariably characterized the human rights situation in Russia as unsatisfactory. However, according to Lukin, this is not discouraging, because building a lawful state and civil society in such a complex country as Russia is a hard and long process. [ 3 ] 
Freedom House considered Russia partially free with scores of 5 on both political rights and civil liberties (1 being most free, 7 least free) in 2002-2004 and not free with 6 on political rights and 5 on civil liberties in 2005-2008 according to the Freedom in the World reports. [ 4 ] In 2006 The Economist published a democracy rating, putting Russia at 102nd place among 167 countries and defining it as a "hybrid regime with a trend towards curtailment of media and other civil liberties." [ 5 ] 
The European Court of Human Rights has become overwhelmed with cases from Russia. As of June 1, 2007, 22.5f its pending cases were directed against the Russian Federation. [ 6 ] In 2006 there were 151 admissible applications against Russia (out of 1634 for all the countries), while in 2005 - 110 (of 1036), in 2004 - 64 (of 830), in 2003 - 15 (of 753), in 2002 - 12 (of 578). [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] 
According to international human rights organizations as well as domestic press, violations of human rights in Russia [ 10 ] include widespread and systematic torture of persons in custody by police, [ 11 ] [ 12 ] dedovshchina in Russian Army, neglect and cruelty in Russian orphanages, [ 13 ] violations of children's rights. [ 14 ] According to Amnesty International there is discrimination, racism, and murders of members of ethnic minorities. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Since 1992 at least 50 journalists have been killed across the country. [ 17 ] 
During the Second Chechen War, started in September 1999, there were summary executions and "disappearances" of civilians in Chechnya. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] According to the ombudsman of the Chechen Republic, Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, as of March 2007 the most complex and painful problem is finding over 2700 abducted and forcefully held citizens; analysis of the complaints of citizens of Chechnya shows that social problems ever more often come to the foreground; two years ago complaints mostly concerned violations of the right to life. [ 21 ] 
The Federal Law of January 10, 2006 changed the orders affecting registration and operation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Russia. [ 3 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] The Russian-Chechen Friendship Society was closed. [ 24 ] 
There are cases of attacks on demonstrators organized by local authorities. [ 25 ] High concern was caused by murders of opposition lawmakers and journalists Anna Politkovskaya, [ 26 ] Yuri Schekochikhin, [ 27 ] Galina Starovoitova, [ 28 ] Sergei Yushenkov, [ 29 ] lawyer Stanislav Markelov, and journalist Anastasia Baburova, as well as imprisonments of human rights defenders, scientists, and journalists like Mikhail Trepashkin, [ 30 ] Igor Sutyagin, [ 31 ] and Valentin Danilov.

Judicial system [ edit ] 
Main article: Judiciary of Russia 
The judiciary is a subject to manipulation by political authorities according to Amnesty International. [ 10 ] [ 33 ] According to Constitution of Russia, top judges are [appointed] by the Federation Council, following nomination by the President of Russia. [ 34 ] Anna Politkovskaya described in her book Putin's Russia stories of judges who did not follow "orders from the above" and were assaulted or removed from their positions. [ 35 ] In an open letter written in 2005, former judge Olga Kudeshkina criticized the chairman of the Moscow city court O. Egorova for " recommending judges to make right decisions" which allegedly caused more than 80 judges in Moscow to retire in the period from 2002 to 2005. [ 36 ] 
In the 1990s, Russia's prison system was widely reported by media and human rights groups as troubled. There were large case backlogs and trial delays, resulting in lengthy pre-trial detention. Prison conditions were viewed as well below international standards. [ citation needed ] Tuberculosis was a serious, pervasive problem. [ 11 ] Human rights groups estimated that about 11, 000 inmates and prison detainees die annually, most because of overcrowding, disease, and lack of medical care. [ 37 ] A media report dated 2006 points to a campaign of prison reform that has resulted in apparent improvements in conditions. [ 38 ] The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation has been working to reform Russia's prisons since 1997, in concert with reform efforts by the national government. [ 39 ] 
The rule of law has made rather limited inroads in the criminal justice since the Soviet time, especially in the deep provinces. [ 40 ] The courts generally follow the non-acquittals policy; in 2004 acquittals constituted only 0.7 percent of all judgments. Judges are dependent on administrators, bidding prosecutorial offices in turn. The work of public prosecutors varies from poor to dismal. Lawyers are mostly court appointed and low paid. There was a rapid deterioration of the situation characterized by abuse of the criminal process, harassment and persecution of defense bar members in politically sensitive cases in recent years. The principles of adversariness and equality of the parties to criminal proceedings are not observed. [ 41 ] 
In 1996, President Boris Yeltsin pronounced a moratorium on the death penalty in Russia. However, the Russian government still violates many promises it made upon entering the Council of Europe. [ 33 ] Citizens who appeal to European Court of Human Rights are often prosecuted by Russian authorities, according to the allegations of Politkovskaya [ 42 ] 
Among the more recent examples of the Government using a court system as a tool of political oppression are the cases of Pussy Riot and Alexei Navalny.
Torture and abuse [ edit ] 
The Constitution of Russia forbids arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment. Chapter 2, Article 21 of the constitution states, "No one may be subjected to torture, violence or any other harsh or humiliating treatment or punishment." [ 43 ] [ 44 ] However Russian police are regularly observed practicing torture - including beatings, electric shocks, rape, asphyxiation - in interrogating arrested suspects. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 45 ] In 2000, human rights Ombudsman Oleg Mironov estimated that 50f prisoners with whom he spoke claimed to have been tortured. Amnesty International reported that Russian military forces in Chechnya engage in torture. [ 43 ] 
In the most extreme cases, hundreds of innocent people from the street were arbitrary arrested, beaten, tortured, and raped by special police forces. Such incidents took place not only in Chechnya, but also in Russian towns of Blagoveshensk, Bezetsk, Nefteyugansk, and others. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] On 2007 Radio Svoboda ("Radio Freedom", part of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) reported that an unofficial movement "Russia the Beaten" was created in Moscow by human rights activists and journalists who "suffered from beatings in numerous Russian cities". [ 49 ] 
In June 2013, construction worker Martiros Demerchyan claimed that he was tortured by Sochi police. Demerchyan, who spent seven weeks constructing housing for the 2014 Winter Olympics, was accused by his supervisor of stealing wiring. Demerchyan denied the allegations but when the victim returned to work to collect his pay, he was met by several police officers who beat him, breaking two of his teeth and sexually assaulted him with a crow bar. He was treated in hospital, but doctors told his family they had found no serious injuries on his body. [ 50 ] 
Torture and humiliation are also widespread in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The term dedovshchina refers to systematic abuse of new conscripts by more long-serving soldiers. [ 51 ] Many young men are killed or commit suicide every year because of it. [ 52 ] It is reported that some young male conscripts are forced to work as prostitutes for "outside clients". [ 53 ] Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia works to protect rights of young soldiers.
The current phenomenon of dedovschina is closely linked to the division of Soviet and now Russian junior soldiers into four 'classes, ' each reflecting a group called up every six months for a total two-year service period. This system stemmed from the adoption of two-year service in 1967. The reduction in the term of service to one year and the increasing number of contract servicemen in the Armed Forces may change the character of dedovschina somewhat.
Crime [ edit ] 
In the 1990s, the growth of organized crime ( see Russian mafia and Russian oligarchs) and the fragmentation of law enforcement agencies in Russia coincided with a sharp rise in violence against business figures, administrative and state officials, and other public figures. [ 54 ] The second President of Russia Vladimir Putin inherited these problems when he took office, and during his election campaign in 2000, the new president won popular support by stressing the need to restore law and order and to bring the rule of law to Russia as the only way of restoring confidence in the country's economy. [ 55 ] 
According to data by Demoscope Weekly, the Russian homicide rate showed a rise from the level of 15 murders per 100, 000 people in 1991, to 32.5 in 1994. Then it fell to 22.5 in 1998, followed by a rise to a maximum rate of 30.5 in 2002, and then a fall to 20 murders per 100, 000 people in 2006. [ 56 ] Despite positive tendency to reduce, Russia's index of murders per capita remains one of the highest in the world with the fifth highest of 62 nations. [ 57 ] 
With a prison population rate of 611 per 100, 000 population, Russia was second only to the United States (2006 data). [ 58 ] Furthermore, criminology studies show that for the first five years since 2000 compared with the average for 1992 to 1999, the rate of robberies is up by 38.2nd the rate of drug-related crimes is higher by 71.7sup id="cite_ref-Inozemtsev_59-0" class="reference"> [ 59 ] 
Political freedom [ edit ] 
Elections [ edit ] 
Russia held elections on 4 December 2011. European Parliament called for new free and fair elections and an immediate and full investigation of all reports of fraud. According to MEPs Russia did not meet election standards as defined by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The preliminary findings of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) report on procedural violations, lack of media impartiality, harassment of independent monitors and lack of separation between party and state. [ 60 ] The Russian government announced its intentions for a more transparent, free, and fair election in the race for the presidency on March 4. The outcome was an election with increased transparency, as web-cameras transmitted the election processes at 95, 000 polling stations. Many observers evaluated this election as one of the "cleanest" elections in Russia's history and more transparent than the Dec 4 Duma elections. However the Russian electoral process still needs more improvement as competition was lacking between the candidates for the presidency.Many common people report the missing of freedom of speech and acting and also a clear missing of democracy and safety for Russians and foreign citizens.
Espionage cases [ edit ] 
During the Soviet period, scientists encountered substantial administrative barriers when working with foreign colleagues [ citation needed ] . After the collapse of the Soviet Union, which coincided with a decrease in government funding of science, many scientists broadened their contacts with foreign laboratories. A point to note is that administrative norms of secrecy in Russia are still more strict than those accepted in the West. [ 61 ] 
There were several cases when the FSB accused scientists of alleged revealing state secrets to foreign nationals, while the defendants and their colleagues claimed that the information or technology was based on already published and declassified sources. Even though the cases often garnered public reaction, the cases themselves were in most cases held in closed chambers, with no press coverage or public oversight.
The scientists in question are:
Igor Sutyagin (sentenced to 15 years). [ 31 ] , Physicist Valentin Danilov (sentenced to 14 years). [ 32 ] , Physical chemist Oleg Korobeinichev (held under a written pledge not to leave city from 2006. [ 62 ] In May 2007 the case against him was closed by FSB for "absence of body of crime". In July 2007 prosecutors publicly apologized to Korobeinichev [ 63 ] for "the image of spy")., Academician Oskar Kaibyshev (given a 6-year suspended sentence and a fine of $130, 000). [ 64 ] [ 65 ] , . 
Ecologist and journalist Alexander Nikitin, who worked with the Bellona Foundation, was likewise accused of espionage. He published material exposing hazards posed by the Russian Navy's nuclear fleet. He was acquitted in 1999 after spending several years in prison (his case was sent for re-investigation 13 times while he remained in prison). Other cases of prosecution are the cases of investigative journalist and ecologist Grigory Pasko, sentenced to three years' imprisonment and later released under a general amnesty, [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Vladimir Petrenko who described dangers posed by military chemical warfare stockpiles and was held in pretrial confinement for seven months, and Nikolay Shchur, chairman of the Snezhinskiy Ecological Fund who was held in pretrial confinement for six months. [ 68 ] 
Other cases [ edit ] 
Viktor Orekhov, a former KGB captain who assisted Soviet dissidents and was sentenced to eight years of prison in the Soviet era, was sentenced in 1995 to three years of prison for alleged possession of a pistol and magazines. After one year he was released and left the country. [ 69 ] 
Vil Mirzayanov was prosecuted for a 1992 article in which he has claimed that Russia was working on chemical weapons of mass destruction, but won the case and later emigrated to the United States [ 70 ] 
Vladimir Kazantsev who disclosed illegal purchases of eavesdropping devices from foreign firms was arrested in August 1995, and released at the end of the year, however the case was not closed. [ 68 ] [ 71 ] Investigator Mikhail Trepashkin was sentenced in May 2004 to four years of prison. [ 30 ] 
Journalist Vladimir Rakhmankov on January 9, 2006 was sentenced for alleged defamation of the President in his article "Putin as phallic symbol of Russia" to fine of 20, 000 roubles (about 695 USD). [ 72 ] [ 73 ] 
Political dissidents from the former Soviet republics, such as authoritarian Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, are often arrested by the FSB and extradited to these countries for prosecution, despite the protests from international human rights organizations. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] The special security services of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaidjan also kidnap people in Russian territory, with the implicit approval of the FSB. [ 76 ] 
Many people were also held in detention to prevent them from demonstrating during the G8 Summit in 2006. [ 77 ] 
Business-related human rights abuses [ edit ] 
There has been a number of high-profile cases of human rights abuses connected to business in Russia. Among other abuses, this most obviously involves abuse of article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. [ 78 ] These include the case of the former heads of the oil company Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and Platon Lebedev whom Amnesty International declared prisoners of conscience, [ 79 ] and the case of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, whose efforts to expose a conspiracy of criminals and corrupt law-enforcement officials earned him sustained abuse in prison which led to his death. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] An analogous case was the death in custody of the businesswoman Vera Trifonova, who was in jail for alleged fraud. [ 83 ] Cases such as these have contributed to suspicion in other countries about the Russian justice system, which has manifested itself in the refusal to grant Russian extradition requests for businessmen fleeing abroad. [ 84 ] Notable instances of this are the cases of the tycoon Boris Berezovsky and former Yukos vice president Alexander Temerko in the UK, the media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky in Spain [ 85 ] and Greece, [ 86 ] Leonid Nevzlin in Israel [ 87 ] and Ivan Kolesnikov in Cyprus. [ 88 ] A case that will test the attitude of the French authorities to this issue is that of the shipping magnate Vitaly Arkhangelsky. The Wikileaks revelations indicated the low level of confidence other governments have in the Russian government on such issues. [ 89 ] Cases involving major companies may gain coverage in the world media, but there are many further cases equally worthy of attention: a typical case involves the expropriation of assets, with criminals and corrupt law-enforcement officials collaborating to bring false charges against businesspeople, who are told that they must hand over assets to avoid criminal proceedings against them. A prominent campaigner against such abuses is Yana Yakovleva, herself a victim who set up the group Business Solidarity in the aftermath of her ordeal. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] 
Suspicious killings [ edit ] 
See also: List of journalists killed in Russia 
Some Russian opposition lawmakers and investigative journalists are suspected to be assassinated while investigating corruption and alleged crimes conducted by state authorities or FSB: Sergei Yushenkov, Yuri Shchekochikhin, Alexander Litvinenko, Galina Starovoitova, Anna Politkovskaya, Paul Klebnikov. [ 27 ] [ 29 ] 
Situation in Chechnya [ edit ] 
Main article: Second Chechen War crimes and terrorism 
The Russian Government's policies in Chechnya are a cause for international concern. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] It has been reported that Russian military forces have abducted, tortured, and killed numerous civilians in Chechnya, [ 92 ] but Chechen separatists have also committed abuses and acts of terrorism, [ 93 ] such as abducting people for ransom [ 94 ] and bombing Moscow metro stations. [ 95 ] Human rights groups are critical of cases of people disappearing in the custody of Russian officials. Systematic illegal arrests and torture conducted by the armed forces under the command of Ramzan Kadyrov and Federal Ministry of Interior have also been reported. [ 96 ] There are reports about repressions, information blockade, and atmosphere of fear and despair in Chechnya. [ 97 ] 
According to Memorial reports, [ 98 ] [ 99 ] there is a system of "conveyor of violence" in Chechen Republic, as well as in neighbouring Ingushetiya. People are suspected in crimes connected with activity of separatists squads, is unlawfully detained by members of security agencies, and then disappears. After a while part of detainees is found in centers of preliminary detention, while some allegedly disappear forever, and then he is tortured to confess to a crime or/and to slander somebody else. Psychological pressure is also in use. [ 100 ] Known Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya compared this system with Gulag and claimed the number of several hundred cases. [ 101 ] 
A number of journalists were killed in Chechnya or supposedly for reporting on the conflict. [ 17 ] [ 102 ] List of names includes less and more famous: Cynthia Elbaum, Vladimir Zhitarenko, Nina Yefimova, Jochen Piest, Farkhad Kerimov, Natalya Alyakina, Shamkhan Kagirov, Viktor Pimenov, Nadezhda Chaikova, Supian Ependiyev, Ramzan Mezhidov and Shamil Gigayev, Vladimir Yatsina, Aleksandr Yefremov, Roddy Scott, Paul Klebnikov, Magomedzagid Varisov, Natalya Estemirova and Anna Politkovskaya. [ 103 ] 
As reported by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe Thomas Hammarberg in 2009, "prior military conflicts, recurrent terrorist attacks (including suicide bombings), as well as wide-spread corruption and a climate of impunity have all plagued the region." [ 104 ] 
According to the Human Rights Centre Memorial, the total number of alleged abductions in Chechnya was 42 during the entire year 2008, whereas already in the first four months of 2009 there were 58 such cases. Of these 58 persons, 45 had been released, 2 found dead, 4 were missing and 7 had been found in police detention units. [ 104 ] In the course of 2008, 164 criminal complaints concerning acts by the security forces were made, 111 of which were granted. In the first half of 2009, 52 such complaints were made, 18 of which were granted. [ 104 ] 
On 16 April 2009 the counter-terrorism operation (CTO) regime in Chechnya was lifted by the federal authorities. After that, the Chechen authorities bear primary responsibility for the fight against terrorism in the Republic. However, the lifting of the CTO regime has not been accompanied by a diminishment of activity of illegal armed groups in Chechnya. [ 104 ] 
There are reports on practices of collective punishment of relatives of alleged terrorists or insurgents: punitive house-burning has continued to be among the tactics against families of alleged insurgents. Chechen authorities confirmed such incidents and pointed out that "such practices were difficult to prevent as they stemmed from prevalent customs of revenge", however, educational efforts are undertaken to prevent such incidents, with the active involvement of village elders and Muslim clerics, and compensation had been paid to many of the victims of punitive house burnings. [ 104 ] 
Reconstruction of Chechnya [ edit ] 
In 2007 report, Thomas Hammarberg noted "the efforts undertaken by the Chechen authorities to reconstruct villages and cities a in particular the capital, Grozny a and welcomed the revival of schools and hospitals". However, as of 2009, "serious economic hardship is one of the overarching problems for the population, with an official unemployment rate amounting to 32.9n Chechnya and 52.1n Ingushetia." [ 104 ] 
On March 25, 2010 airport of Grozny became opened for international flights. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] 
Governmental organizations [ edit ] 
Efforts to institutionalize official human rights bodies have been mixed. In 1996, human rights activist Sergei Kovalev resigned as chairman of the Presidential Human Rights Commission to protest the government's record, particularly the war in Chechnya. Parliament in 1997 passed a law establishing a "human rights ombudsman, " a position that is provided for in Russia's constitution and is required of members of the Council of Europe, to which Russia was admitted in February 1996. The State Duma finally selected Duma deputy Oleg Mironov in May 1998. A member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Mironov resigned from both the Party and the Duma after the vote, citing the law's stipulation that the Ombudsman be nonpartisan. Because of his party affiliation, and because Mironov had no evident expertise in the field of human rights, his appointment was widely criticized at the time by human rights activists. [ citation needed ] 
Non-governmental organizations [ edit ] 
The lower house of the Russian parliament passed a bill by 370-18 requiring local branches of foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to re-register as Russian organizations subject to Russian jurisdiction, and thus stricter financial and legal restrictions. The bill gives Russian officials oversight of local finances and activities. The bill has been highly criticized by Human Rights Watch, Memorial organization, and the INDEM Foundation for its possible effects on international monitoring of the status of human rights in Russia. [ 107 ] In October 2006 the activities of many foreign non-governmental organizations were suspended using this law; officials said that "the suspensions resulted simply from the failure of private groups to meet the law's requirements, not from a political decision on the part of the state. The groups would be allowed to resume work once their registrations are completed." [ 23 ] Another crackdown followed in 2007. [ 108 ] 
Freedom of religion [ edit ] 
See also: Religion in Russia 
The Constitution of Russian Federation provides for freedom of religion and the equality of all religions before the law as well as the separation of church and state. As Vladimir Lukin had stressed in his 2005 Ombudsman's report, "the Russian state has achieved significant progress in the observance of religious freedom and lawful activity of religious associations, overcoming a heritage of totalitarianism, domination of a single ideology and party dictatorship". [ 109 ] 
Russia is a multi-ethnic country with a large majority of Orthodox Christians (61 high proportion of Muslims (12 1f Jews, about 1f Catholics, and so on. According to Alvaro Gil-Robles, relations between the representatives of the different religious communities are generally harmonious. [ 2 ] 
Gil-Robles emphasized the amount of state support provided by both federal and regional authorities for the different religious communities, and stressed the example of the Republic of Tatarstan as "veritable cultural and religious melting pot". [ 2 ] Along with that, Catholics are not always heeded as well as other religions by federal and local authorities. [ 2 ] 
Vladimir Lukin noted in 2005, that citizens of Russia rarely experience violation of freedom of conscience (guaranteed by the article 28 of the Constitution). [ 109 ] So, the Commissioner's Office annually accepts from 200 to 250 complaints dealing with the violation of this right, usually from groups of worshipers, who represent various confessions: Orthodox (but not belonging to the Moscow patriarchy), Old-believers, Muslim, Protestant and others. [ 109 ] 
The different problem arises with concern of citizens' right to association (article 30 of the Constitution). [ 109 ] As Vladimir Lukin noted, although quantity of the registered religious organizations constantly grows (22144 in 2005), an increasing number of religious organization fail to achieve legal recognition: e.g. Jehovah's Witnesses, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and others. [ 109 ] 
The influx of missionaries over the past several years has led to pressure by groups in Russia, specifically nationalists and the Russian Orthodox Church, to limit the activities of these "nontraditional" religious groups. [ citation needed ] In response, the Duma passed a new, restrictive, and potentially discriminatory law in October 1997. The law is very complex, with many ambiguous and contradictory provisions. The law's most controversial provisions separates religious "groups" and "organizations" and introduces a 15-year rule, which allows groups that have existed for 15 years or longer to obtain accredited status. According to Russian priest and dissident Gleb Yakunin, new religion law "heavily favors the Russian Orthodox Church at the expense of all other religions, including Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism.", and it is "a step backward in Russia's process of democratization". [ 110 ] 
The claim to guarantee "the exclusion of any legal, administrative and fiscal discrimination against so-called non-traditional confessions" was adopted by PACE in June 2005. [ 111 ] 
Anna Politkovskaya described cases of prosecution and even murders of Muslims by Russia's law enforcement bodies at the North Caucasus. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] However, there are plenty of Muslims in higher government, Duma, and business. [ 114 ]

Reporters Without Borders put Russia at 147th place in the World Press Freedom Index (from a list of 168 countries). [ 115 ] According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 47 journalists have been killed in Russia for their professional activity, since 1992 (as of January 15, 2008). Thirty were killed during President Boris Yeltsin's reign, and the rest were killed under the president Vladimir Putin. [ 17 ] [ 116 ] According to the Glasnost Defence Foundation, there were 8 cases of suspicious deaths of journalists in 2007, as well as 75 assaults on journalists, and 11 attacks on editorial offices. [ 117 ] In 2006, the figures were 9 deaths, 69 assaults, and 12 attacks on offices. [ 118 ] In 2005, the list of all cases included 7 deaths, 63 assaults, 12 attacks on editorial offices, 23 incidents of censorship, 42 criminal prosecutions, 11 illegal layoffs, 47 cases of detention by militsiya, 382 lawsuits, 233 cases of obstruction, 23 closings of editorial offices, 10 evictions, 28 confiscations of printed production, 23 cases of stopping broadcasting, 38 refusals to distribute or print production, 25 acts of intimidation, and 344 other violations of Russian journalist's rights. [ 119 ] 
Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, famous for her criticisms of Russia's actions in Chechnya, and the pro-Kremlin Chechya government, was assassinated in Moscow. Former KGB officer Oleg Gordievsky believes that the murders of writers Yuri Shchekochikhin (author of Slaves of KGB ), Anna Politkovskaya, and Aleksander Litvinenko show that the FSB has returned to the practice of political assassinations, [ 120 ] practised in the past by the Thirteenth KGB Department. [ 121 ] 
Opposition journalist Yevgenia Albats in interview with Eduard Steiner has claimed: "Today the directors of the television channels and the newspapers are invited every Thursday into the Kremlin office of the deputy head of administration, Vladislav Surkov to learn what news should be presented, and where. Journalists are bought with enormous salaries." [ 122 ] 
Freedom of assembly [ edit ] 
See Freedom of assembly in Russia See Moscow Pride See Strategy-31 
Russian Constitution (1993) states of the Freedom of assembly that citizens of the Russian Federation shall have the right to gather peacefully, without weapons, and to hold meetings, rallies, demonstrations, marches and pickets. [ 123 ] 
According to Amnesty International (2013 report) peaceful protests across Russia, including gatherings of small groups of people who presented no public threat or inconvenience, were routinely dispersed by police, often with excessive force. The day before the inauguration of President Putin, peaceful protesters against elections to Bolotnaya Square in Moscow were halted by police. 19 protesters faced criminal charges in connection with events characterized by authorities as amass riotsa. Several leading political activists were named as witnesses in the case and had their homes searched in operations that were widely broadcast by state-controlled television channels. Over 6 and 7 May, hundreds of peaceful individuals were arrested across Moscow. [ 124 ] According to Amnesty International police used excessive and unlawful force against protestors dring the Bolotnaya Square protest on 6 May 2012. Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested. [ 125 ] 
Ethnic minorities [ edit ] 
See also: Ethnic groups in Russia and List of endangered languages in Russia 
Russian Federation is a multi-national state with over 170 ethnic groups designated as nationalities, population of these groups varying enormously, from millions in case of e.g. Russians and Tatars to under ten thousand in the case of Nenets and Samis. [ 2 ] Among 83 subjects which constitute the Russian Federation, there are 21 national republics (meant to be home to a specific ethnic minority), 5 autonomous okrugs (usually with substantial or predominant ethnic minority) and an autonomous oblast. However, as Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe Gil-Robles noted in 2004 report, whether or not the region in "national", all the citizens have equal rights and no one is privileged or discriminated on account of their ethnic affiliation. [ 2 ] 
As Gil-Robles noted, although co-operation and good relations are still generally the rule in most of regions, tensions do arise, whose origins vary. Their sources include problems related to peoples that suffered Stalinists repressions, social and economic problems provoking tensions between different communities, and the situation in Chechnya and the associated terrorist attacks with resulting hostility towards people from the Caucasus and Central Asia, which takes the form of discrimination and overt racism towards the groups in question. [ 2 ] 
Committee of Ministers of Council of Europe [ 126 ] in May 2007 issued concern that Russia still hasn't adopted comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, and the existing anti-discrimination provisions are seldom used in spite of reported cases of discrimination. [ 127 ] 
As Gil-Robles has noted in 2004, minorities are generally represented on local and regional authorities, and participate actively in public affairs. Gil-Robles emphasized the degree of co-operation and understanding between the various nationalities living in the same area, as well as the role of regional and local authorities in ethnic dialogue and development. [ 2 ] Along with that, Committee of Ministers in 2007 noted certain setbacks in minority participation in public life, including the abrogation of federal provisions for quotas for indigenous people in regional legislatures. [ 127 ] 
Although the Constitution of the Russian Federation recognises Russian as the official language, the individual republics may declare one or more official languages. Most of subjects have at least two a Russian and the language of the "eponymous" nationality. [ 2 ] As Ministers noted in 2007, there is a lively minority language scene in most subjects of the federation, with more than 1, 350 newspapers and magazines, 300 TV channels and 250 radio stations in over 50 minority languages. Moreover, new legislation allows usage of minority languages in federal radio and TV broadcasting. [ 127 ] 
In 2007, there were 6, 260 schools which provided teaching in altogether 38 minority languages, and over 75 minority languages were taught as a discipline in 10, 404 schools. Ministers of Council of Europe has noted efforts to improve the supply of minority language textbooks and teachers, as well as greater availability of minority language teaching. However, as Ministers has noted, there remain shortcomings in the access to education of persons belonging to certain minorities. [ 127 ] 
There are more than 2, 000 national minorities' public associations and 560 national cultural autonomies, however the Committee of Ministers has noted that in many regions amount of state support for the preservation and development of minority cultures is still inadequate. [ 127 ] Alvaro Gil-Robles noted in 2004, that there's a significant difference between "eponymous" ethnic groups and nationalities without their own national territory, as resources of the last are relatively limited. [ 2 ] 
Russia is also home of a particular category of minority peoples, i.e. small indigenous peoples of the North and Far East, who maintain very traditional lifestyles, often in a hazardous climatic environment, while adapting to the modern world. [ 2 ] After the fall of the Soviet Union Russian Federation passed legislation to protect rights of small northern indigenous peoples. [ 2 ] Gil-Robles has noted agreements between indigenous representatives and oil companies, which are to compensate potential damages on peoples habitats due to oil exploration. [ 2 ] As Committee of Ministers of Council of Europe noted in 2007, despite some initiatives for development, the social and economic situation of numerically small indigenous peoples was affected by recent legislative amendments at the federal level, removing some positive measures as regards their access to land and other natural resources. [ 127 ] 
Alvaro Gil-Robles noted in 2004, that like many European countries, Russian Federation is also host to many foreigners, who when concentrated in a particular area make up so-called new minorities, who experience troubles e.g. with medical treatment due to absence of registration. Those who are registered encounter other integration problems because of language barriers. [ 2 ] 
Committee of Ministers has noted in 2007 that despite efforts to improve access to residency registration and citizenship for national minorities, still those measures haven't regularised the situation of all the persons concerned. [ 127 ] 
Foreigners and migrants [ edit ] 
On October 2002 the Russian Federation has introduced new legislation on legal rights of foreigners, designed to control immigration and clarify foreigners' rights. Despite this legal achievement, as of 2004, numerous foreign communities in Russia faced difficulties in practice (according to Alvaro Gil-Robles). [ 2 ] 
As of 2007, almost 8 million migrants are officially registered in Russia, [ 128 ] while some 5-7million migrants do not have legal status. [ 129 ] 
Most of foreigners arriving in Russia are seeking jobs. In many cases they have no preliminary contracts or other agreements with a local employer. A typical problem is the illegal status of many foreigners (i.e., they are not registered and have no identity papers), what deprives them of any social assistance (as of 2004) and often leads to their exploitation by the employer. Despite that, foreigner workers still benefit, what with seeming reluctance of regional authorities to solve the problem forms a sort of modus vivendi . [ 2 ] As Gil-Robles noted, it's easy to imagine that illegal status of many foreigners creates grounds for corruption. Illegal immigrants, even if they have spent several years in Russia may be arrested at any moment and placed in detention centres for illegal immigrants for further expulsion. As of 2004, living conditions in detention centers are very bad, and expulsion process lacks of funding, what may extend detention of immigrants for months or even years. [ 2 ] Along with that, Gil-Robles detected a firm political commitment to find a satisfactory solution among authorities he spoke with. [ 2 ] 
There's a special case of former Soviet citizens. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, 1991 Nationality Law recognised all former Soviet citizens permanently resident in the Russian Federation as Russian citizens. However, people born in Russia who weren't on the Russian territory when the law came into force, as well as some people born in the Soviet Union who lived in Russia but weren't formally domiciled there weren't granted Russian citizenship. When at December 31, 2003 former Soviet passports became invalid, those people overnight become foreigners, although many of them considered Russia their home. The majority were even deprived of retirement benefits and medical assistance. Their morale has also been seriously affected since they feel rejected. [ 2 ] 
Another special case are Meskhetian Turks. Victims of both Stalin deportation from South Georgia and 1989 pogroms in the Fergana valley in Uzbekistan, some of them were eventually dispersed in Russia. While in most regions of Russia Meskhetian Turks were automatically granted Russian citizenship, in Krasnodar Krai some 15, 000 Meskhetian Turks were deprived of any legal status since 1991. [ 2 ] Unfortunately, even measures taken by Alvaro Gil-Robles in 2004 didn't make Krasnodar authorities to change their position; Vladimir Lukin in the 2005 report called it "campaign initiated by local authorities against certain ethnic groups". [ 109 ] The way out for a significant number of Meskhetian Turks in the Krasnodar Krai became resettlement in the United States. [ 130 ] As Vladimir Lukin noted in 2005, there was similar problem with 5.5 thousand Yazidis who before the disintegration of the USSR moved to the Krasnodar Krai from Armenia. Only one thousand of them were granted citizenship, the others could not be legalized. [ 109 ] 
In 2006 Russian Federation after initiative proposed by Vladimir Putin adopted legislation which in order to "protect interests of native population of Russia" provided significant restrictions on presence of foreigners on Russian wholesale and retail markets. [ 131 ] 
There was a short campaign of frequently arbitrary and illegal detention and expulsion of ethnic Georgians on charges of visa violations and a crackdown on Georgian-owned or Georgian-themed businesses and organizations in 2006, as a part of 2006 Georgian-Russian espionage controversy. [ 132 ] 
Newsweek reported that "[In 2005] some 300, 000 people were fined for immigration violations in Moscow alone. [In 2006], according to Civil Assistance, numbers are many times higher." [ 133 ] 
Racism and xenophobia [ edit ] 
Main article: Racism in Russia See also: Russia for Russians 
As Alvaro Gil-Robles noted in 2004, the main communities targeted by xenophobia are the Jewish community, groups originating from the Caucasus, migrants and foreigners. [ 2 ] 
In his 2006 report, Vladimir Lukin has noted rise of nationalistic and xenophobic sentiments in Russia, as well as more frequent cases of violence and mass riots on the grounds of racial, nationalistic or religious intolerance. [ 3 ] [ 16 ] [ 134 ] 
Human rights activists point out that 44 people were murdered and close to 500 assaulted on racial grounds in 2006. [ 135 ] According to official sources, there were 150 "extremist groups" with over 5000 members in Russia in 2006. [ 136 ] 
The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has noted in 2007, that high-level representatives of the federal administration have publicly endorsed the fight against racism and intolerance, and a number of programmes have been adopted to implement these objectives. This has been accompanied by an increase in the number of convictions aimed at inciting national, racial or religious hatred. However, there has been an alarming increase in the number of racially motivated violent assaults in the Russian Federation in four years, yet many law enforcement officials still often appear reluctant to acknowledge racial or nationalist motivation in these crimes. Hate speech has become more common in the media and in political discourse. The situation of persons originating in the Northern Caucasus is particularly disturbing. [ 127 ] 
Vladimir Lukin noted that inactivity of the law enforcement bodies may cause severe consequences, like September 2006 inter-ethnic riot in town Kondopoga of the Republic of Karelia. Lukin noted provocative role of the so-called Movement Against Illegal Immigration. As the result of the Kondopoga events, all heads of the "enforcement bloc" of the republic were fired from their positions, several criminal cases were opened. [ 3 ] 
According to nationwide opinion poll carried by VCIOM in 2006, 44f respondents consider Russia "a common house of many nations" where all must have equal rights, 36hink that "Russians should have more rights since they constitute the majority of the population", 15hink "Russia must be the state of Russian people". However the question is also what exactly does the term "Russian" denote. For 39f respondents Russians are all who grew and were brought up in Russia's traditions; for 23ussians are those who works for the good of Russia; 15espondents think that only Russians by blood may be called Russians; for 12ussians are all for who Russian language is native, for 7ussians are adepts of Russian Christian Orthodox tradition. [ 137 ] 
According to statistics published by Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, in 2007 in Russia foreign citizens and people without citizenship has committed 50, 1 thousand crimes, while the number of crimes committed against this social group was 15985. [ 138 ] 
As reported by the Associated Press, in 2010 SOVA-Center noted a significant drop of racially motivated violence in Russia in 2009, related to 2008: "71 people were killed and 333 wounded in racist attacks last [2009] year, down from 110 killed and 487 wounded in 2008". According to a SOVA-Center report, the drop was mostly "due to police efforts to break up the largest and most aggressive extremist groups in Moscow and the surrounding region". Most of the victims were "dark-skinned, non-Slavic migrant laborers from former Soviet republics in Central Asia ... and the Caucasus". As Associated Press journalist Peter Leonard commended, "The findings appear to vindicate government claims it is trying to combat racist violence". [ 139 ] 
Psychiatric institutions [ edit ] 
See also: Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union and Political abuse of psychiatry in Russia 
There are numerous cases in which people that are crazy for Russian authorities who have been imprisoned in psychiatric institutions during the past several years. [ 140 ] [ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] 
Little has changed in the Moscow Serbsky Institute where many prominent Soviet dissidents had been incarcerated after having been diagnosed with sluggishly progressing schizophrenia. This Institute conducts more than 2, 500 court-ordered evaluations per year. When war criminal Yuri Budanov was tested there in 2002, the panel conducting the inquiry was led by Tamara Pechernikova, who had condemned the poet Natalya Gorbanevskaya in the past. Budanov was found not guilty by reason of "temporary insanity". After public outrage, he was found sane by another panel that included Georgi Morozov, the former Serbsky director who had declared many dissidents insane in the 1970s and 1980s. [ 144 ] Serbsky Institute also made an expertise of mass poisoning of hundreds of Chechen school children by an unknown chemical substance of strong and prolonged action, which rendered them completely incapable for many months. [ 145 ] The panel found that the disease was caused simply by "psycho-emotional tension". [ 146 ] [ 147 ] 
Disabled and children's rights [ edit ] 
See also: Dima Yakovlev Act 
Currently, an estimated 2 million children live in Russian orphanages, with another 4million children on the streets. [ 148 ] According to a 1998 Human Rights Watch report, [ 13 ] "Russian children are abandoned to the state at a rate of 113, 000 a year for the past two years, up dramatically from 67, 286 in 1992. Of a total of more than 600, 000 children classified as being 'without parental care, ' as many as one-third reside in institutions, while the rest are placed with a variety of guardians. From the moment the state assumes their care, orphans in Russia a of whom 95 percent still have a living parent a are exposed to shocking levels of cruelty and neglect." Once officially labelled as retarded, Russian orphans are "warehoused for life in psychoneurological institutions. In addition to receiving little to no education in such institutions, these orphans may be restrained in cloth sacks, tethered by a limb to furniture, denied stimulation, and sometimes left to lie half-naked in their own filth. Bedridden children aged five to seventeen are confined to understaffed lying-down rooms as in the baby houses, and in some cases are neglected to the point of death." Life and death of disabled children in the state institutions was described by writer Ruben Gallego. [ 149 ] [ 150 ] Despite these high numbers and poor quality of care, recent laws have made adoption of Russian children by foreigners considerably more difficult.
Human trafficking [ edit ] 
Main article: Human trafficking in Russia 
The end of communism and collapse of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has contributed to an increase in human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] Russia is a country of origin for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Russia is also a destination and transit country for persons trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation from regional and neighbouring countries into Russia and beyond. Russia accounted for one-quarter of the 1, 235 identified victims reported in 2003 trafficked to Germany. The Russian government has shown some commitment to combat trafficking but has been criticised for failing to develop effective measures in law enforcement and victim protection. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] 
Right of asylum [ edit ] 
Russia gave right of asylum for American Edward Snowden who was asylum seeker. Most European countries denied his application, while majority of their citizens support Snowden. [ citation needed ]
