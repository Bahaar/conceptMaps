History [ edit ] 
The AvtoVAZ assembly line in 1969 
Post-Soviet adjustments [ edit ] 
See also: Automobile industry of the Soviet Union 
The Soviet Union possessed a large automotive industry. In late 1987, the industry produced 2 million cars, satisfying 45f the domestic demand. [ 2 ] But after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the industry faced a crisis due to competitive foreign imports. Japanese brands overtook the lower-end Ladas; on the high-end sector, Volga sales dropped in favor of German-built Mercedes and BMWs. By 1993, total output was down 14ompared to 1990 levels. Lada's declining sales during the 1990s, and toughening European Union emissions requirements, saw exports to Western Europe discontinued by the end of the decade. Lada had enjoyed particularly strong sales in Britain, peaking at more than 30, 000 sales a year in the late 1980s, but had failed to remain competitive with other budget brands over the subsequent few years.
2000 to 2008 [ edit ] 
The total numbers of cars and trucks produced in Russia between 2000a2011. The Russian automotive market boomed in 2005a2008. 
In the early 2000s, the Russian economy recovered. Macroeconomic trends were strong and growing incomes of the population led to a surging demand, and by 2005 the Russian car market was booming. In 2005, 1, 446, 525 new cars were sold, including 832, 200 Russian models and 614, 325 foreign ones. Foreign companies started to massively invest in production in Russia: the number of foreign cars produced in Russia surged from 157, 179 in 2005 to 456, 500 in 2007. [ 3 ] The value of the Russian market grew at a brisk pace: 14n 2005, 36n 2006 and 67n 2007amaking it the world's fastest growing automotive market by 2008. [ 4 ] 
To boost the market share of locally produced vehicles, the Russian government implemented several protectionist measures and launched programs to attract foreign producers into the country. In late 2005, the Russian government enacted legislation to create special economic zones (SEZ) with the aim of encouraging investments by foreign automotive companies. The benefits of operating in the special economic zones include tax allowances, exemption from asset and land taxes and protection against changes in the tax regime. Some regions also provide extensive support for large investors (over $100million.) These include Saint Petersburg/Leningrad Oblast (Toyota, GM, Nissan) and Kaluga Oblast (VW). Kaluga has been especially successful in attracting foreign companies, as has been Kaliningrad Oblast. [ 4 ] 
Since the 2000s, foreign companies have been flocking to enter Russia, seeing Russia as a local production location and export powerhouse. Russia's labor, material and energy costs are only 1/6 compared to those in Western Europe. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] 
Global financial crisis [ edit ] 
President Vladimir Putin meeting with AvtoVAZ employees in the company's factory in Tolyatti. 
Russia's automotive industry was hit hard by the late 2000s recession, which started in the United States. Production of passenger cars dropped from 1, 470, 000 units in 2008 to just 597, 000 units in 2009. Lorry production fell from 256, 000 to 91, 000 in the same period. [ 7 ] 
In late 2008, the Russian government introduced protectionist measures, worth $5billion, to improve the situation in the industry. This included $2billion of bailouts for troubled companies and $3billion of credits for buyers of Russian cars. [ 8 ] Prime minister Vladimir Putin described the move as vital in order to save jobs. [ 9 ] The tariffs for imported foreign cars and trucks were increased to a minimum of 50nd go up to 100The tariffs are linked to the engine size of the vehicle. The increased duties led to protests in Russian cities, most notably in Vladivostok, where the importation of Japanese cars is an important sector of the city's economy. [ 10 ] To compensate for the losses of the Vladivostok businesses, Prime Minister Putin ordered the car manufacturing company Sollers to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok. The move was completed in 2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It was planned to produce 13, 200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010. [ 11 ] 
The most efficient anti-crisis measure executed by the Russian government was the introduction of a car scrappage scheme in March 2010. Under the scheme, buyers of new cars could receive a subsidy of up to 600, 000 rubles (20, 000 USD). [ 12 ] Sales of Russia's largest carmaker Avtovaz doubled in the second quarter of 2010 as a result, and the company returned to profit. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] 
Recent developments [ edit ]

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Nine out of the ten most sold models in Russia in 2010 were domestically produced, with Avtovaz's Lada models topping the list. [ 15 ] In the first 7 months of 2010, sales of Lada cars increased by 60the Korean KIA reported a jump of 101and Chevrolet's sales rose by 15sup id="cite_ref-rt_topgear_17-0" class="reference"> [ 17 ] 
In 2010, Russia was the world's 15th largest producer of cars. The Russian automotive industry currently (as of 2010) accounts for about 2f worldwide car production. [ 18 ]

Structure [ edit ] 
The Russian automotive industry can be divided into four types of companies: local brand producers, foreign OEMs, joint ventures and Russian companies producing foreign brands. [ 19 ] In 2008, there were 5, 445 companies manufacturing vehicles and related equipment in Russia. The volume of production and sales amounted to 1, 513billion rubles. [ 7 ]

The car was introduced on 13 December 2010 in Moscow, a product of a joint venture between Yarovit, a producer of trucks based in St. Petersburg, Russia and the Onexim investment group, headed by Mikhail Prokhorov, who is the leader and financier of the project. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Prokhorov plans to invest around a150million (US$200million) in the venture, [ 24 ] intending the vehicle to "break the stereotype saying Russia can't produce good cars." [ 25 ]

The main administration building of Avtovaz in Togliatti 
Russia's automotive industry is a significant economic sector. It directly employs 600, 000 people and supports around 2a3million people in related industries. [ 16 ] It is politically a very important part of the country's economy: firstly, due to the large number of employed people and secondly, because many citizens depend on the social services provided by automotive companies. For example, the well-being of the giant AvtoVAZ factory in Tolyatti is massively important to the city or to the region of Samara Oblast. [ 28 ] Tolyatti is a typical monotown, a city whose economy is dependent on a single company. The factory employs around 100, 000 people of the city's population of 700, 000. [ 29 ] 
In 2009, former President Dmitry Medvedev launched the Medvedev modernisation programme, which aims to diversify Russia's raw materials and energy-dominated economy, turning it into a modern high-tech economy based on innovation. Following this, Russia's automotive industry has been in the spotlight due to its great potential for modernisation.
Former Prime Minister and current President Vladimir Putin has taken a personal interest in the automotive industry. In a symbolic gesture of support, Putin made a highly publicized road trip on the new Amur Highway in August 2010, driving 2, 165 kilometers in a Lada Kalina Sport. [ 30 ] Putin described the car as "excellent, even beyond my expectations", and praised it as "comfortable" and "almost noise-free." [ 31 ] The event was intended to show support for AvtoVAZ, which was recovering from the serious economic crisis. [ 32 ] 
Market characteristics [ edit ] 
History [ edit ] 
Tsarist Russia [ edit ] 
The first car was imported into the Russian Empire in 1891 in Odessa. In St. Petersburg, the first car appeared in 1895, in Moscow in 1899.
Russia's first car was built in 1896 by engineers and Frese and Yakovlev on based car Benz Velo. In the future, the most successful manufacturer was Russo-Balt (Riga), was released in the period 1909a1915 years about 500 vehicles of various seriy.Suschestvovali and other manufacturers (Puziryev, Ilyin), but each s are released more than a few dozen cars.
The main part of the fleet cars were foreign brands. Cars do not become a mass means of transportation. By the beginning of World War I, Russia had 10, 000 machines (for comparison, in the U.S., 1.3 million in the UK 245 000, 100 000 in France).
During the First World War, in 1916 the government began construction of several factories in Moscow (AMO plant, later became plant ZIS and later ZiL), Yaroslavl (in Soviet trucks YaAZ released in 1958 became the Yaroslavl Motor Works) as well as in Mytishchi, Rybinsk, Rostov-on-Don (all these plants did not produce cars, and were converted). Due to the events of 1917 they were completed only after the Revolution.
During the Civil War in Russia [ edit ] 
All private vehicles were requisitioned.
In the civil war automotive industry actually stayed.The only automaker AMO was produced in the years 1917-1919 of kits Fiat 15 Ter. Thereafter, he, like all automobile factories, became engaged in repair.
20s [ edit ] 
Became the first Soviet car truck AMO-F15 based on Fiat-15Ter, unreleased in 1925a1931 years in the factory AMO actually manually.
The first Soviet passenger car was NAMI-1 (NAMI - Scientific motor institute , Russian DDNNDND DDNDDDNDNDND DDNNDNNN ), released in 1927a1930 years.
During these years, their needs USSR tried to cover imports, which began in the 1925 year.
Prewar [ edit ] 
In 1929 the Soviet government appealed for help in the organization of automobile production in the United States. To study in the United States were engineers were sent.
Began a large-scale construction of such plants as GAZ (Gorky Automobile Plant, which opened in the 1932 year), The burden of the first produced under license Ford Model A and Ford Model AA and KIM(Plant named Communist Youth International; GAZ branch opened in the 1929 year). AMO plant was renovated, renamed in 1933 in ZIS (factory named after Stalin). All they first began to assembly-line production. Design base was created, began their own development.
Imports were virtually abandoned.
In the 1937 year began production of the first Soviet car ZIS-101 luxury class, used by members of the Government.
In 1940 was launched the first all-wheel drive car GAZ-61, use the command of the army and made the first attempt to issue a public car KIM-10 (this plant was separated from GAZ), was unsuccessful, before the start of the Great Patriotic War was released only 500 pieces.
By 1938, the Soviet Union took the first place in Europe and second in the world for the production of trucks. Before the war, the automotive industry of the USSR produced more than 1 million cars, most of which came in the Red Army.
Great Patriotic War [ edit ] 
During the Great Patriotic War Automobile ZiS was evacuated to the rear, where on the basis of its equipment have created new and automakers UlZIS and UralZIS (now UAZ and UralAZ). GAZ in 1943 year bombed, but did not stop work. During the war has spread from the car assembly machine-kit supplied under Lend-Lease.
In 1941 began production of the first Soviet jeep GAZ-64.
The postwar period [ edit ] 
In 1946 began production of the first car with a ponton body GAZ-M20 Pobeda, in 1948 at a former factory KIM, renamed MZMA (Moscow Plant of small cars), began production of the first compact car based on the pre-war Opel Kadett- Moskvitch 400.
These cars were the first authorized for sale to individuals, before the war, the car can only be obtained as a reward for services received and all were requisitioned from the outbreak of hostilities.
But the car is still considered a luxury because of the price several times higher than the average salary and clearly insufficient volumes of passenger cars compared to trucks and buses, which led to a economic shortage, which is characteristic for the whole of the Soviet economy (because it is a command-planned character control had no communication with customers and therefore there is a disproportion in the production of different products).
To buy a car, you had to join the queue, which could last for several years. At the same time an acquaintance could get the car faster. Another problem was the lack of service stations for private owners, so they were forced to do repairs yourself.
In 1966, construction began on the plant VAZ ( Volga Automobile Plant ) project concern Fiat . He was commissioned in 1970 and the first time released a Soviet version of the Fiat 124- VAZ-2101 . Simultaneously across the country were built the service station this brand. Cars that were the first truly mass . They were in huge demand and they immediately formed defitsit.Many people preferred them, despite the fact that there was a cheaper car " Zaporozhets ", as they are quite different from the other marks dynamics and comfort.
Demand for cars "Moskvitch " gradually began to decline and by 1980 it could be bought freely.
Cars "Zaporozhets" also could be bought freely, but they were not prestigious .
The most prestigious brands of selling cars " GAZ Volga" unreleased, too, were a huge deficit, to buy "Volga", often had to pay a bribe . Besides, up to 60f their release sent in the organization and taxis.
Top class cars, limousines ZIL and GAZ Chaika were banned for sale and officials issued as part of a set of privileges.
The entire issue UAZ jeeps went into the army and state agencies . Among other SUVs could buy LuAZ and VAZ-2121 Niva .
In the 1950s there was a massive export cars overseas, which began with the car GAZ M-20 "Pobeda" (which was sold even in the U.S.) and the Moskvich-400. Peak export cars "Moskvich" and "Volga" came in the 60s (in 1969 were exported 64f cars Moskvitch 408 and 412). Special organization engaged in export Avtoexport. Export stopped in the middle 90s.
At the same time start the import, mainly trucks and buses (mostly from socialist countries), brands such as ZSD Nysa, Zuk, Avia, Tatra, Ikarus, Multicar, Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde. In the 70-80s for international transport tractors purchased Volvo and Mercedes-Benz with trailers. Cars are not purchased. Import was performed by the same organization Avtoexport.
Perestroika [ edit ] 
The second half of the 80s hit a new peak deficit.
In 1988, when he was allowed a small business started free sale of trucks and buses, before definitely prohibited for sale and distributed enterprises.
In the early 90s there was a massive import of cars.
1990-2000s [ edit ]
