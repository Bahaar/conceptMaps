(February 2010) , The Russian Criminal Code (Russian: DDDDDDDND DDDDDN DDNNDDNDDD DDDDNDNDD, frequently abbreviated DD DD ) is the prime source of Law of the Russian Federation concerning criminal offences. The previous Criminal Code of the Russian Federation came into force on 1 January 1997. Moreover, on the 8 January President Yeltsin signed the Criminal Correctional Code to regulate the conditions of the sentences. The new Criminal Code replaced the Soviet analogue of 1960. The main changes deal with economic crimes and property crimes. These were the main pitfalls of the Soviet Criminal Code, as most of other chapters were already amended to correspond to new Russian realities.
