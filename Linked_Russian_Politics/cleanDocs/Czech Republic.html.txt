Political developments [ edit ] 
The Czech political scene supports a broad spectrum of parties ranging from Communist Party on the far left to various nationalistic parties on the far right. Generally, the (liberal) right beyond the specific case of huge and conservative Civic Democratic Party is splintered and has failed in several attempts to unite.
Czech voters returned a split verdict in the June 2002 parliamentary elections, giving Social Democrats (ASSD) and Communists majority, without any possibility to form a functioning government together due to VladimAr Apidla's strong anticommunism. The results produced a ASSD coalition government with Christian Democrats (KDU-ASL) and Liberals (US-DEU), while Civic Democrats (ODS) and Communists (KSAM) took place in opposition. The MP ratio was the tiniest 101:99. After many buffetings and, finally, after the catastrophic results of the June European Parliament election, 2004 Apidla resigned after a revolt in his own party and the government was reshuffled on the same basis.

As the system in Czech repeatedly produces very weak governments (a specific problem is that about 15f the electorate support the Communists, who are shunned by all the other parties) there is constant talk about changing it but without much chance of really pushing the reform through. An attempt to increase majority elements by tweaking the system parameters (more smaller districts, d'Hondt method used) by ASSD and ODS during their "opposition agreement" 1998a2002 was vehemently opposed by smaller parties and blocked by the Constitutional Court as going too much against the constitution-stated proportional principle; only a moderated form was adopted. This, however led to a stalemate in 2006 elections where both the left and the right each gained exactly 100 seats; as many commenters point out, the earlier system would have given the right 3a4 seats majority.
In March 2006, the parliament overturned a veto by President VAclav Klaus, and the Czech Republic became the first former communist country in Europe to grant legal recognition to same-sex partnerships.
A government formed of a coalition of the ODS, KDU-ASL, and the Green Party (SZ), and led by the leader of the ODS Mirek TopolAnek finally succeeded in winning a vote of confidence on 19 January 2007. This was thanks to two members of the ASSD, MiloA MelAAk and Michal Pohanka, who abstained.
On 23 March 2009, the government of Mirek TopolAnek lost a vote of no-confidence.
Executive branch [ edit ]

Main article: Parliament of the Czech Republic Interior of SnAmovna Wallenstein Palace a Seat of the Senate in Prague 
The Parliament ( Parlament AeskA republiky ) has two chambers. The Chamber of Deputies ( PoslaneckA snAmovna ) has 200 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation with a 5a href="/wiki/Election_threshold" title="Election threshold">election threshold. There are 14 voting districts identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, at first the Czech National Council, has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former Czechoslovakia.
The Senate ( SenAt ) has 81 members, in single-seat constituencies elected by two-round runoff voting for a six-year term, with one third renewed every even year in the autumn. The first election was 1996 (for differing terms). This is patterned after the U.S. Senate but each constituency is of (roughly) same size and the system used is two-round runoff voting. The Senate is unpopular among the public and suffers from low election turnout (overall roughly 30n the first round, 20n the second).
