, v , t , e , . , Politics of East Timor takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential parliamentary representative democratic republic, [ 1 ] whereby the Prime Minister of East Timor is the head of government and the President of East Timor exercises the functions of head of state. East Timor has a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Parliament. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The East Timorese constitution was modelled on that of Portugal, though the president is less powerful than his Portuguese counterpart. The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions.

Executive branch [ edit ] 
Government Palace in Dili 
The Head of state of the East Timorese republic is the president, who is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and whose executive powers are somewhat limited by the constitution, though he is able to veto legislation which can be overridden by the parliament. Following elections, the president appoints as the prime minister, the leader of the majority party or majority coalition. As head of government the prime minister presides over the cabinet.
