Formerly, the ruble was also the currency of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union before their dissolution. Belarus and Transnistria use currencies with the same name. The ruble is subdivided into 100 kopeks (sometimes written as kopecks or copecks ; Russian: DDDDIDDD , kopeyka ; plural: DDDDIDDD , kopeyki ). The ISO 4217 code is RUB or 643; the former code, RUR or 810, refers to the Russian ruble before the 1998 redenomination (1 RUB = 1000 RUR).

History [ edit ] 
Etymology [ edit ] 
Main article: Ruble 
According to the most popular version, the word "rouble" is derived from the Russian verb NNDDINN ( rubit' ), meaning "to chop".
Names of different denominations [ edit ] 
In the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, several coins had individual names:
A kopek a polushka , A kopek a denga or dAnezhka , 2 kopek a semishnik (mostly disappeared by 20th century), dvAshka (20th century) or grosh , 3 kopek a altyn (not in use anymore by the 1960s), 5 kopek a pyatAk , 10 kopek a grAvennik , 15 kopek a pyatialtAnny (5 altyn; the usage lived longer than altyn), 20 kopek a dvugrAvenny (2 grivenniks), 25 kopek a polupoltAnnik (half poltAnnik) or chetvertAk (from the Russian for A), 50 kopek a poltAna or poltAnnik , . 
The amount of 10 roubles (in either bill or coin) is sometimes informally referred to as a chervonets . Historically, it was the name for the first Russian three-rouble gold coin issued for general circulation in 1701. The current meaning comes from the Soviet golden chervonets (NDDDINNDDD DDDDNDID NDNDDIDDN), issued in 1923. It was equivalent to the pre-revolution 10 gold roubles. All these names are no longer in use, however. The practice of using the old kopek coin names for amounts in roubles is not very common today. In modern Russian slang only these names are used:
1 rouble a tselkAvy (NDDDDIDND), meaning "entire" or "whole" (NDIDND), 5 roubles a pyatyArka (DNNNNDD), pyatAk (DNNDID), pyatachyAk (DNNDNDID), 10 roubles a chArik (NDINDD), chervAnets (NDNDDIDDN) or desyAtka (DDNNINDD), 50 roubles a poltAnnik (DDDNDIDDDD) with some variants like poltishAk (DDDNDNDID), pyAtr (DNNN) from picture of monument to the Peter I shown on a bill, 100 roubles a stAlnik (NNDIDNDDD), sAtka (NDNDD), 500 roubles a pyatikhAtka (DNNDNDINDD), originally pyatikAtka (DNNDDDINDD), 1, 000 roubles a kosAr (DDNDINN), shtAka (NNNIDD) or a hybrid shtukAr (NNNDDNN), tAnna (NDIDDD) (mostly in St. Petersburg), 1, 000, 000 roubles a limAn (DDDDID), lyam (DND), 1, 000, 000, 000 roubles lyard (DNND)., . 
The sixth term derived from "DNNN DDNN" (five Catherines). Katya (DDNN, Catherina), having been a slang name for the 100 rouble note in tsarist Russia, was used as the note had a picture of Catherine II on it.
The biggest denomination note, as of September 2009, is 5000 roubles, so all the higher amount nicknames refer to amount and not the coin or banknote.
Some of these definitions ( chirik, poltos, pyatikatka, and kosar ) come from Russian jail slang (Fenya), and are considered vulgar in daily speech. [ citation needed ] 
Currency symbol [ edit ] 
A currency symbol was used for the ruble between the 16th century and the 18th century. The symbol consisted of the Russian letters "D" (rotated by 90A counter-clockwise) and "D" (written on top of it). The symbol was placed over the amount number it belonged to. [ 7 ] This symbol, however, fell into disuse during the 19th century and onward. [ citation needed ] 
The eventual winning Ruble sign design 
No official symbol was used during the final years of the Empire, nor was one introduced in the Soviet Union. The characters R [ 8 ] [ 9 ] and NND. were used and remain in use today, though they are not official. [ 10 ] 
In July 2007, the Central Bank of Russia announced that it would decide on a symbol for the ruble and would test 13 symbols. This included the symbol DD (the initials of DDNNDDNDDD DNDDN "Russian ruble"), which has received preliminary approval from the Central Bank. [ 11 ] However, one more symbol, a D with a horizontal stroke below the top similar to the Philippine peso sign, was proposed unofficially. [ 11 ] Proponents of the new sign claim that it is simple, recognizable and similar to other currency signs. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] This symbol is also similar to the Armenian letter O.
On 11 December 2013, the official symbol for the ruble became , a Cyrillic letter er with a single added horizontal stroke, [ 15 ] [ 16 ] though the abbreviation NND. is in wide use. In Unicode version 7.0 it was assigned the encoding U+20BD a ruble sign (HTML: and #8381; ). [ 17 ] [ 18 ] 
On 4 February 2014, the Unicode Technical Committee during its 138th meeting in San Jose accepted U+20BD a ruble sign symbol for the Unicode version 7.0, [ 19 ] the symbol was then included into Unicode 7.0 released on 16 June 2014. [ 20 ] In August 2014, Microsoft issued updates for all of its mainstream versions of Microsoft Windows that enabled support for the new ruble sign, [ 21 ] but the updates were later found to have bugs that result in system crashes. [ 22 ] 
First ruble (antiquitya31 December 1921) [ edit ] 
Five hundred rubles featuring Peter the Great and a personification of Mother Russia, 1912 
, This section does not cite any references or sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2012) , 1898 Russian Empire one ruble bill, obverse 
The ruble has been the Russian unit of currency for about 500 years. From 1710, the ruble was divided into 100 kopeks.
The amount of precious metal in a ruble varied over time. In a 1704 currency reform, Peter the Great standardized the ruble to 28grams of silver. While ruble coins were silver, there were higher denominations minted of gold and platinum. By the end of the 18th century, the ruble was set to 4 zolotnik 21 dolya (almost exactly equal to 18grams) of pure silver or 27 dolya (almost exactly equal to 1.2grams) of pure gold, with a ratio of 15:1 for the values of the two metals. In 1828, platinum coins were introduced with 1 ruble equal to 77a dolya (3.451grams).
On 17 December 1885, a new standard was adopted which did not change the silver ruble but reduced the gold content to 1.161grams, pegging the gold ruble to the French franc at a rate of 1 ruble = 4 francs. This rate was revised in 1897 to 1 ruble = 2a francs (0.774grams gold).
The ruble was worth about .50 USD in 1914. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] 
With the outbreak of World War I, the gold standard peg was dropped and the ruble fell in value, suffering from hyperinflation in the early 1920s. With the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian ruble was replaced by the Soviet ruble. The pre-revolutionary Chervonetz was temporarily brought back into circulation from 1922-1925. [ 25 ] 
Coins [ edit ] 
At the beginning of the 19th century, copper coins were issued for A, A, 1, 2 and 5 kopeks, with silver 5, 10, 25 and 50 kopeks and 1 ruble and gold 5 although production of the 10 ruble coin ceased in 1806. Silver 20 kopeks were introduced in 1820, followed by copper 10 kopeks minted between 1830 and 1839, and copper 3 kopeks introduced in 1840. Between 1828 and 1845, platinum 3, 6 and 12 rubles were issued. In 1860, silver 15 kopecs were introduced, due to the use of this denomination (equal to 1 zAoty) in Poland, whilst, in 1869, gold 3 rubles were introduced. [ 26 ] In 1886, a new gold coinage was introduced consisting of 5 and 10 ruble coins. This was followed by another in 1897. In addition to smaller 5 and 10 ruble coins, 7A and 15 ruble coins were issued for a single year, as these were equal in size to the previous 5 and 10 ruble coins. The gold coinage was suspended in 1911, with the other denominations produced until the First World War.
Constantine ruble [ edit ] 
The Constantine ruble (Russian: DDDNNDDNDDDDNDDD NNDDN , pronounced "konstantinovsky rubl'") is a rare silver coin of the Russian Empire bearing the profile of Constantine, the brother of emperors Alexander I and Nicholas I. Its manufacture was being prepared at the Saint Petersburg Mint during the brief Interregnum of 1825, but it was never minted in numbers, and never circulated in public. The fact of its existence became known in 1857 in foreign publications. [ 27 ] 
Banknotes [ edit ] 
For banknotes issued between 1918 and 1992 see: Soviet ruble
Imperial issues [ edit ] 
25 Assignation rubles of 1769 1898 Russian Empire one ruble bill, reverse 
In 1768, during the reign of Catherine the Great, the Assignation Bank was instituted to issue the government paper money. It opened in St. Petersburg and in Moscow in 1769.
In 1769, Assignation rubles were introduced for 25, 50, 75 and 100 rubles, with 5 and 10 rubles added in 1787 and 200 ruble in 1819. The value of the Assignation rubles fell relative to the coins until, in 1839, the relationship was fixed at 1 coin ruble = 3A assignat rubles. In 1840, the State Commercial Bank issued 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles notes, followed by 50 ruble credit notes of the Custody Treasury and State Loan Bank.
In 1843, the Assignation Bank ceased operations, and state credit notes (Russian: DDNNDDNNNDDDDND DNDDDNDND DDDDNN ) were introduced in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles. These circulated, in various types, until the revolution, with 500 rubles notes added in 1898 and 250 and 1000 rubles notes added in 1917. In 1915, two kinds of small change notes were issued. One, issued by the Treasury, consisted of regular style (if small) notes for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 kopeks. The other consisted of the designs of stamps printed onto card with text and the imperial eagle printed on the reverse. These were in denominations of 1, 2, 3, 10, 15 and 20 kopeks.
Provisional Government issues [ edit ] 
In 1917, the Provisional Government issued treasury notes for 20 and 40 rubles. These notes are known as "Kerenski" or "Kerensky rubles". The provisional government also had 25 and 100 rubles state credit notes printed in the U.S.A. but most were not issued.
Post-Soviet ruble (1993a1998) [ edit ] 
Further information: Soviet ruble Further information: Monetary reform in Russia, 1993 
Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the ruble remained the currency of the Russian Federation. A new set of banknotes was issued in the name of Bank of Russia in 1993. During the period of hyperinflation of the early 1990s, the ruble was significantly devalued.
Coins [ edit ] 
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation introduced new coins in 1992 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 rubles. The coins depict the double headed eagle above the legend "DDDD DDNNDD." The 1 and 5 rubles were minted in brass-clad steel, the 10 and 20 rubles in cupro-nickel and the 50 and 100 rubles were bimetallic (aluminium-bronze and cupro-nickel-zinc). In 1993, aluminium-bronze 50 rubles and cupro-nickel-zinc 100 rubles were issued, and the material of 10 and 20 rubles was changed to nickel-plated steel. In 1995 the material of 50 rubles was changed to brass-plated steel, but the coins were minted with the old date 1993. As high inflation persisted, the lowest denominations disappeared from circulation and the other denominations became rarely used.
During this period the commemorative one-ruble coin is regularly issued. It's practically identical in size and weight to a 5 Swiss franc coin (worth approx. a3 / US$4). For this reason, there have been several instances of (now worthless) ruble coins being used on a large scale to defraud automated vending machines in Switzerland. [ 28 ] 
Banknotes [ edit ] 
In 1961, new State Treasury notes were introduced for 1, 3 and 5 rubles, along with new State Bank notes for 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles. In 1991, the State Bank took over production of 1, 3 and 5 ruble notes and also introduced 200, 500 and 1, 000 ruble notes, although the 25 ruble note was no longer issued. In 1992, a final issue of notes was made bearing the name of the U.S.S.R. before the Russian Federation introduced notes for 5, 000 and 10, 000 rubles. These were followed by 50, 000 ruble notes in 1993, 100, 000 rubles in 1995 and finally 500, 000 rubles in 1997 (dated 1995). Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian ruble banknotes and coins have been notable for their lack of portraits, which traditionally were included under both the Tsarist and Communist regimes. With the issue of the 500 ruble note depicting a statue of Peter I and then the 1000 ruble note depicting a statue of Yaroslav, the lack of recognizable faces on the currency has been partially alleviated.

The ruble was redenominated on 1 January 1998, with one new ruble equaling 1000 old rubles. The redenomination was a purely psychological step that did not solve the fundamental economic problems faced by the Russian economy at the time, and the currency was devalued in August 1998 following the 1998 Russian financial crisis. The ruble lost 70f its value against the U.S. dollar in the six months following this financial crisis.
In November 2004, the authorities of Dimitrovgrad (Ulyanovsk Oblast) erected a five-meter monument to the ruble.
On 23 November 2010, at a meeting of the Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, it was announced that Russia and China have decided to use their own national currencies for bilateral trade, instead of the U.S. dollar. The move is aimed to further improve relations between Beijing and Moscow and to protect their domestic economies during the Great Recession. The trading of the Chinese yuan against the ruble has started in the Chinese interbank market, while the yuan's trading against the ruble was set to start on the Russian foreign exchange market in December 2010. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] 
Coins [ edit ] 
In 1998, the ruble was once again revalued and the following coins were introduced:

In some cases, the 10 kopeck coin is disregarded (refused by individuals but is accepted by vendors and is mandatory for offer in exchange). [ citation needed ] 
All these coins began being issued in 1998, despite the fact that some of them bear the year 1997. Kopeck denominations all depict St. George and the Dragon, and all ruble denominations (with the exception of bimetallic commemorative pieces) depict the double headed eagle. Mint marks are denoted by "D" or "M" on kopecks and the logos of either the Leningrad or Moscow mints on rubles. Since 2000, many bimetallic 10 ruble circulating commemorative coins have been issued. These coins have a unique holographic security feature inside the "0" of the denomination 10. [ citation needed ] 
In 2008, it was proposed by the Bank of Russia to withdraw 1 and 5 kopeck coins from circulation and to round all the prices to 10 kopecks, although the proposal hasn't been realized yet (though characteristic "x.99" prices are treated as rounded in exchange). [ citation needed ] 
The material of 1, 2 and 5 ruble coins was switched from copper-nickel-zinc and copper nickel clad to nickel plated steel in the second quarter of 2009. 10 and 50 kopeks were also changed from aluminum-bronze to brass steel clad. [ citation needed ] 
In October 2009, a new 10 ruble coin made of brass plated steel was issued, featuring optical security features. [ 36 ] The 10 ruble banknote would have been withdrawn in 2012, but a shortage of 10-ruble coins prompted the Central Bank to delay this and put new ones in circulation. [ 37 ] Bimetallic commemorative 10 ruble coins will continue to be issued. [ citation needed ] 
A series of circulating Olympic commemorative 25 ruble coins will start in 2011. The new coins will be made of cupronickel. [ citation needed ] A number of commemorative smaller denominations of these coins exist in circulation as well, depicting national historic events and anniversaries.
The Bank of Russia issues other commemorative non-circulating coins ranging from 1a50, 000 rubles. See [ 38 ] for listing.

Printing [ edit ] 
All Russian ruble banknotes are currently printed at the state-owned factory Goznak in Moscow, which was organized on 6 June 1919 and has continued to operate ever since. Coins are minted in Moscow and at the Saint Petersburg Mint, which has been operating since 1724.
Controversy [ edit ] 
On 8 July 2014 State Duma deputy and Vice-Chairman of the Duma Regional Political Committee Roman Khudyakov declared that the image of Apollo driving Quadriga on the portico of the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on the 100 rouble banknote constitutes pornography that should only be available to persons over the age of 18. Since it is impractical to limit the access of minors to banknotes, he requested in his letter to the Governor of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina to urgently change the design of the banknote. [ 41 ] 
Roman Khudyakov, a member of parliament for the LDPR party stated, "You can clearly see that Apollo is naked, you can see his genitalia. I submitted a parliamentary request and forwarded it directly to the head of the central bank asking for the banknote to be brought into line with the law protecting children and to remove this Apollo." [ 42 ] [ 43 ] 
Exchange rates [ edit ] 
In January 2014, President Putin said there should be a sound balance on the ruble exchange rate, that regarding the national currency exchange rate, the Central Bank only regulated it when it went beyond the upper and lower limits of the floating exchange rate and that the freer the Russian national currency is, the better it is, adding that this would make the economy react more effectively and timely to processes taking place in it.
