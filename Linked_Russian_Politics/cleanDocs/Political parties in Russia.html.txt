, v , t , e , . , This article lists political parties in Russia . Russia has a multi-party system. Currently there are four parties that make up the federal parliament, the State Duma, with one dominant party (United Russia).
After Perestroika, in the 1990s there were over 100 registered parties in Russia, but people elected in State Duma only a small number of parties. Since 2000, during Vladimir Putin's presidency, the number of parties very quickly decreased. Last years from 2008 to 2012 there were only 7 parties in Russia, and every new attempt to register new independent parties was blocked. The last registered party was government-organized Right Cause. Before 2011 parliamentary elections, about 10 opposition parties were refused in registration. But after a series of mass protests and thanks to a 2011 European Court decision on Case of the Republican Party of Russia, the law was changed and the number of registered parties quickly increased to more than 48 in December 2012. About 200 parties are in creation stage (as 2012) according to the Justice Ministry website.

History [ edit ] 
Party of power [ edit ] 
Main article: Party of power 
In Russian politics, the party of power is the specially established party which unconditionally supports current president or prime minister in the parliament.
These parties were considered as parties of power:
Interregional Group of Deputies/Democratic Russia (1990-1993, Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union/Congress of People's Deputies of Russia/Supreme Soviet of Russia), Choice of Russia (1993-1995), Our Home a Russia (1995-1999), Ivan Rybkin Bloc (considered as potential left "party of power", during Russian legislative election, 1995), Unity (1999-2001/2003), United Russia (2001-present), A Just Russia (2006-2008/2010, the second "party of power", support of Vladimir Putin and opposition to United Russia), . 
Legislation [ edit ] 
Main article: Elections in Russia Certificate of state registration of political parties in Russia, issued by the Ministry of Justice of Russia 
, This section is empty. You can help by adding to it. (September 2014) , Social composition of voters [ edit ] 
Main article: Electoral geography of Russia 
According to studies, United Russia voters in 2007 were younger and more market-oriented than the average voter. The party's electorate includes a substantial share of government employees, pensioners and military personnel, who are dependent on the state for their livelihood. [ 1 ] Sixty-four percent of United Russia supporters are female. According to researchers [ who? ] , this could be because women place a great value on stability. In the run-up to the 2011 Duma elections, it was reported that support for United Russia was growing among young people. [ 2 ] 
Registered parties [ edit ] 
All parties registered by the Ministry of Justice have the right to participate in any elections all over the country. The list is placed on the Justice Ministry website. On December 2012 there are 48 registered parties in Russia, 4 of them are currently represented in the State Duma.
