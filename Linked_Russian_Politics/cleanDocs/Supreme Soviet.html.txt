First session of the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia (indirect) * , Meeting place , White House, Footnotes ^ Last direct (but rigged) general elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR were held in 1985. Powers of that Supreme Soviet (XI convocation) had expired in May 1990 (just some months after passage of the 1989 constitutional amendments), The Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR (Russian: DDNNDDDND DDDDN DDDDD , Verkhovniy Sovet RSFSR ), later Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation (Russian: DDNNDDDND DDDDN DDNNDDNDDD DDDDNDNDD , Verkhovniy Sovet Rossiyskoi Federatsii ) was the supreme government institution of the Russian SFSR in 1938a1990; in 1990a1993 it was a permanent parliament, elected by the Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR was established as similar structure as the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1938, instead of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) as the highest organ of power of Russia.
In the 1940s, the Supreme Soviet Presidium and the Council of Ministers of the Russian SFSR were located in the former mansion of counts Ostermanov (str Delegatskaya, 3), [ 1 ] which was later in 1991 given to a museum. The sessions were held in Grand Kremlin Palace. In 1981 the Supreme Soviet was moved to a specially constructed building on Krasnopresnenskaya embankment, The House of Soviets.
The Supreme Soviet was abolished in October 1993 (after the events of Russia's 1993 constitutional crisis) and replaced by the Federal Assembly of Russia (consists of the Federation Council of Russia and State Duma), whose powers are weaker than Supreme Soviet ones.
