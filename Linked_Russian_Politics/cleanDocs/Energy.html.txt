Russia is rich in energy resources. Russia has the largest known natural gas reserves of any state on earth, along with the second largest coal reserves, and the eighth largest oil reserves. This is 32f world proven natural gas reserves (23f the probable reserves), 12f the proven oil reserves, 10f the explored coal reserves (14f the estimated reserves) and 8f the proven uranium reserves. [ 4 ] 
With recent acquisitions, Russia has gained assets in the Black Sea that may be worth trillions of dollars. [ 5 ] 
Author Bill McKibben has estimated that to avoid "cratering" our civilisation due to climate change, up to $20tn worth of fossil fuel reserves will need to remain in the ground, essentially worthless. While the international community worked the global climate agreement in 2015 to hold warming to 2C in this century, an oil-drunk Russian autocracy is using more and more oil and gas before three-quarters of Russiaas natural capital becomes worthless. This strategy ignores the Polluter pays principle according to which the climate change costs are paid with the oil and gas profits. [ 6 ] 
Natural gas [ edit ] 
Major existing and planned natural gas pipelines supplying Russian gas to Europe. Russian natural gas as af domestic consumption. Major recipients of Russian natural gas exports in 2007. 
Russia has identified the gas sector as being of key strategic importance. The share of natural gas as a primary energy source is remarkably high compared to the rest of world. Russia has the world biggest natural gas reserves, mainly owned and operated by the Russian monopoly Gazprom, which produces 94f Russia's natural gas production. In global context Gazprom holds 25f the world's known gas reserves and produces 16f global output. [ 7 ] In 2011, Russia was the world's biggest natural gas producer with 677billion cubic metres (23.9trillion cubic feet) which accounted 20.0f global natural gas production. It is also the biggest gas exporter with 196billion cubic metres (6.9trillion cubic feet). [ 8 ] The main export markets of Russian natural gas are the European Union and the CIS. Russia supplies a quarter of the EU gas consumption, mainly via transit trough Ukraine (Soyuz, Brotherhood) and Belarus (Yamal-Europe pipeline). The main importers are Germany (where links were developed as a result of Germany's Ostpolitik during the 1970s, [ 9 ] and also Ukraine, Belarus, Italy, Turkey, France and Hungary.
Oil [ edit ] 
Main article: Oil industry of Russia 
Russia is the largest oil producer in the non-OPEC countries, and second biggest in the world after Saudi Arabia, [ 10 ] which it overtakes as the world's number one from time to time. [ 11 ] In 2006, Russia contributed 12.1f global oil production and 11.6f global oil exports. [ 12 ] In June 2006, Russian crude oil and condensate production reached the post-Soviet maximum of 9.7 million barrels (1, 540, 000m 3 ) per day, exceeding production in 2000 by 3.2Mbbl/d (510, 000m 3 /d). Russian export consists more than 5Mbbl/d (790, 000m 3 /d) of oil and nearly 2Mbbl/d (320, 000m 3 /d) of refined products, which go mainly to the European market. The domestic demand in 2005 was 2.6Mbbl/d (410, 000m 3 /d) on average. [ 13 ] Russia is also the main transit country for oil from Kazakhstan.
The biggest Russian oil company is Rosneft followed by Lukoil, TNK-BP, Surgutneftegaz, Gazprom Neft and Tatneft. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] All oil trunk pipelines (except the Caspian Pipeline Consortium) are owned and operated by the state-owned monopoly Transneft; oil products pipelines are owned and operated by its subsidiary Transnefteproduct. Currently, Transneft is constructing the Eastern Siberia a Pacific Ocean oil pipeline that would bring Russian oil to the Asian-Pacific markets (China, Japan, Korea).
Coal [ edit ] 
Main article: Coal power in Russia 
Russia has the worldas second largest coal reserves, with 157 billion tonnes of reserves.
Russian coal reserves are widely dispersed. The principal hard coal deposits are located in the Pechora and Kuznetsk basins. The Kansk-Achinsk basin contains huge deposits of brown coal. The Siberian Lena and Tunguska basins constitute largely unexplored resources, the commercial exploitation of which would probably be difficult. [ 16 ] 
Hydropower [ edit ] 
Hydropower accounts for about 21f Russia's total electric power production. Russia now has 102 hydropower plants in operation, with aggregate installed capacity of over 35 GW. Russia's RusHydro is the world's second-largest hydroelectric power producer. [ 17 ] 
Non-conventional oil [ edit ] 
Oil shale [ edit ] 
Russia owns the biggest oil shale reserves in Europe equal to 35.47 billion tonnes of shale oil. More than 80 oil shale deposits have been identified. Main deposits are located in the Volga-Petchyorsk province and the Baltic Basin. Extraction of the deposits in the Volga-Petchyorsk province began in the 1930s, but was abandoned due to environmental problems. Main oil shale industry was concentrated on the Baltic Basin in Slantsy, but at the end of the 1990s the Slantsy oil shale processing plant and oil shale-fired power station were converted to use traditional hydrocarbons and mining activities ceased before 2005. In Syzran a small processing plant continues to operate. [ 18 ] 
Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil [ edit ] 
Small extra-heavy oil reserves have been identified in the Volga-Urals and North Caucasus-Mangyshlak basins. Large deposits of natural bitumen are located in Eastern Siberia in the Lena-Tunguska basin. Other bitumen deposits are located in the Timan-Pechora and Volga-Urals Basins, and in Tatarstan. [ 19 ] In September 2007, Tatneft and Royal Dutch Shell announced a strategic partnership to develop heavy crude oil production in Tatarstan, where Tatneft already has pilot production of bitumen. [ 20 ] 
Uranium [ edit ] 
Uranium exploration and development activities have been largely concentrated on three east-of-Urals uranium districts (Transural, West Siberia and Vitim). The most important uranium producing area has been the Streltsovsky region near Krasnokamensk in the Chitinskaya Oblast. In 2005, the Russian Federation was the worldas fourth largest producer of uranium, accounting for 8.2f global output. [ 21 ] 
Power generation [ edit ] 
See also: Electricity sector in Russia Russia's electricity production by source in 2007 
Russia is the world's fourth largest electricity producer after the USA, China, and Japan. In 2005, Russia produced 951TWh and exported 23TWh of electricity. [ 22 ] Roughly 63f Russia's electricity is generated by thermal plants, 21y hydropower and 16omes from nuclear reactors. [ 23 ] Russia exports electricity to the CIS countries, Latvia, Lithuania, China, Poland, Turkey and Finland.
Hydropower [ edit ] 
Gross theoretical potential of the Russian hydro resource base is 2, 295TWh per year, of which 852TWh is regarded as economically feasible. Most of this potential is located in Siberia and the Far East. [ 24 ] Hydro generation (including pumped-storage output) in 2005 was 175TWh, which represents 5.8f world hydroelectricity generation. Russia ranks as the fifth largest hydroelectricity producer in the world. [ 25 ] At the end of 2005 installed hydroelectric generating capacity was 45.7GW. [ 24 ] 
Nuclear energy [ edit ] 
Main article: Nuclear power in Russia 
In 2005 nuclear energy supply in Russia amounted to 149TWh, which is 15.7f total Russian electricity output and 5.4f global nuclear energy production. [ 26 ] The total installed capacity of nuclear reactors is 21, 244MW. There are plans to increase the number of commercial reactors from thirty one to fifty nine.
From 2001 all Russian civil reactors were operated by Energoatom. On 19 January 2007 Russian Parliament adopted legislation which created Atomenergoprom - a holding company for all Russian civil nuclear industry, including Energoatom, the nuclear fuel producer and supplier TVEL, the uranium trader Tekhsnabexport (Tenex) and nuclear facilities constructor Atomstroyexport.
Renewable energy [ edit ] 
Main article: Renewable energy in Russia 
Non-hydroelectric renewable energy in Russia is largely undeveloped although Russia has many potential renewable energy resources.
Geothermal energy [ edit ] 
Main article: Geothermal power in Russia 
Geothermal energy, which is used for heating and electricity production in some regions of the Northern Caucasus and the Far East, is the most developed renewable energy source in Russia. [ 23 ] Geothermal resources have been identified in the Northern Caucasus, Western Siberia, Lake Baikal, and in Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands. In 1966 a 4MWe single-flash plant was commissioned at Pauzhetka (currently 11MWe) followed by a 12MWe geothermal power plant at Verkhne Mutnovsky, and 50MWe Mutnovsky geothermal power plant. At the end of 2005 installed capacity for direct use amounted to more than 307MWt. [ 27 ] 
Peat [ edit ] 
Principal peat deposits are located in the north-western parts of Russia, in West Siberia, near the western coast of Kamchatka and in several other far-eastern regions. The Siberian peatlands account for nearly 75f Russia's total reserves of 186billion tonnes, second only to Canadaas. Approximately 5f exploitable peat (1.5million tonnes per annum) is used for fuel production. Although peat was used as industrial fuel for power generation in Russia for a long period, its share has been in long-term decline, and since 1980 has amounted to less than 1sup id="cite_ref-wec331_28-0" class="reference"> [ 28 ] 
Solar energy [ edit ] 
It has been estimated that Russia's gross potential for solar energy is 2.3trillion tce. The regions with the best solar radiation potential are the North Caucasus, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea areas, and southern parts of Siberia and the Far East. This potential is largely unused, although the possibilities for off-grid solar energy or hybrid applications in remote areas are huge. However, the construction of a single solar power plant Kislovodskaya SPP (1.5MW) has been delayed. [ 29 ] 
Wind energy [ edit ] 
Russia has high quality wind resources on the Pacific and Arctic coasts and in vast steppe and mountain areas. Large-scale wind energy systems are suitable in Siberia and the Far East (east of Sakhalin Island, the south of Kamchatka, the Chukotka Peninsula, Vladivostok), the steppes along the Volga river, the northern Caucasus steppes and mountains and on the Kola Peninsula, where power infrastructure and major industrial consumers are in place. At the end of 2006, total installed wind capacity was 15MW. Major wind power stations operate at Kalmytskaya (2MW), Zapolyarnaya (1.5MW), Kulikovskaya (5.1MW), Tyupkildi (2.2MW) and Observation Cape (2.5MW). Feasibility studies are being carried out on the Kaliningradskaya (50MW) and the Leningradskaya (75MW) wind farms. There are about 100MW of wind projects in Kalmykia and in Krasnodar Krai. [ 30 ] 
Tidal energy [ edit ] 
A small pilot tidal power plant with a capacity of 400kW was constructed at Kislaya Guba near Murmansk in 1968. In 2007, Gidro OGK, a subsidiary of the Unified Energy System (UES) began the installation of a 1.5MW experimental orthogonal turbine at Kislaya Guba. If it proves successful, UES plans to continue with Mezen Bay (15, 000MW) and Tugur Bay (7, 980MW) projects. [ 31 ]
