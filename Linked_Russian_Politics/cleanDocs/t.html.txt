I have taken the liberty (WP:BOLD) of removing some of the entries from the history timeline, as there was undue weight placed on them as opposed to similar events and places.
1) I have removed the selective revolution and war entries, mainly because Russia has been part of many wars and revolutions, each of them being quite important. It would not make sense to cherry pick them, or to list them all in this small summary template. In addition, they are all listed and described in the "Military History" article/link which I have left for reference.
2) I removed the two "invasions" links as they were by no means unique, and do not fit in the list which mainly includes predecessor entities of Russia. Also, they are practically duplicate lists of events mentioned in the "History" and "Timeline" links/articles, which still remain.
3) I have removed a few entities that have little relation to the historical continuity of Russia. These include the Bosphoran Kingdom (a Hellenic entity that existed hundreds of years before the Slavs arrived to the area which is now Ukraine/Romania.), Khazaria (no relation to Russia, part of the Turkic nations of North Caucasus), Volga Bulgaria (because it was just a tiny part of what is now, Russia. If you keep it, might as well list the 150+ other kingdoms that used to be part of what is now Russia.), and the Golden Horde (because although it was important to Russian history, it was not unique in that sense, and it was not actually part of the Russian states, it just received payments from some of them, for a while.)
