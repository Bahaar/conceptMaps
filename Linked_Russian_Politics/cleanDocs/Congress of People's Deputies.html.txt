Two major blocs quickly formed in opposition to each other a the Communist Bloc, and the Democratic Russia Bloc. The aDemocratic Russiaa and its allies were initially in the majority, which allowed Yeltsin to be elected as the Chairman of the Presidium. During the fifth session, dual membership in fractions was outlawed, aone deputy a one fractiona law was passed. However, dual membership still remained an issue and in April 1992 there were 30 deputies with membership in several fractions.
