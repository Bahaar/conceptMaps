The rate of suicide has been steadily decreasing since it peaked at around 40 per 100, 000 in the mid-late 90s, including a 30rop from 2001 to 2006. [ 4 ] In 2007 about 22f all suicides were committed by people aged 40a49, and almost six times as many Russian males commit suicide as females. [ 5 ]

Further information: Alcoholism in Russia 
Heavy alcohol use is a significant factor in the suicide rate, with an estimated half of all suicides a result of alcohol abuse. [ 2 ] [ 6 ] This is evident by the fact that Russia's suicide rate since the mid-90s has declined alongside per capita alcohol consumption, despite the economic crises since then; alcohol consumption is more of a factor than economic conditions. [ 6 ] 
Teenage suicides [ edit ] 
In 2012, the rate of teenage suicides in Russia was three times higher than the world average. [ 7 ]
