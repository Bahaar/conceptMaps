Federal subjects [ edit ] 
Main article: Federal subjects of Russia Federal subjects of Russia 
Since March18, 2014, the Russian Federation consisted of eighty-five federal subjects that are constituent members of the Federation. [ 1 ] However, two of these federal subjectsathe Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopolaare internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. All federal subjects are of equal federal rights in the sense that they have equal representationatwo delegates eachain the Federation Council (upper house of the Federal Assembly). They do, however, differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.
There are 6types of federal subjectsa22republics, 9krais, 46oblasts, 3federal cities, 1autonomous oblast, and 4autonomous okrugs.
Autonomous okrugs are the only ones that have a peculiar status of being federal subjects in their own right, yet at the same time they are considered to be administrative divisions of other federal subjects (with Chukotka Autonomous Okrug being the only exception).
2014 Crimean crisis [ edit ] 
On March18, 2014, as a part of the 2014 Crimean crisis events and following the establishment of the Republic of Crimea (an independent entity recognized only by Russia), a treaty was signed between Russia and the Republic of Crimea incorporating the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol as the constituent members of the Russian Federation. [ 2 ] According to the Treaty, the Republic of Crimea is accepted as a federal subject with the status of a republic while the City of Sevastopol has received federal city status. [ 2 ] Neither the Republic of Crimea nor the city of Sevastopol are politically recognized as parts of Russia by most countries. [ 3 ] 
Administrative divisions [ edit ] 
Prior to the adoption of the 1993 Constitution of Russia, the administrative-territorial structure of Russia was regulated by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of August17, 1982 "On the Procedures of Dealing with the Matters of the Administrative-Territorial Structure of the RSFSR". [ 4 ] The 1993 Constitution, however, did not identify the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions as the responsibility of the federal government nor as the joint responsibility of the federal government and the subjects. This was interpreted by the governments of the federal subjects as a sign that the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions became solely the responsibility of the federal subjects. [ 4 ] As a result, the modern administrative-territorial structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another. While the implementation details may be considerably different, in general, however, the following types of high-level administrative divisions are recognized:
administrative districts (raions), cities/towns and urban-type settlements of federal subject significance, closed administrative-territorial formations, . 
Autonomous okrugs and okrugs are intermediary units of administrative divisions, which include some of the federal subject's districts and cities/towns/urban-type settlements of federal subject significance.
Autonomous okrugs, while being under the jurisdiction of another federal subject, are still constitutionally recognized as federal subjects on their own right. Chukotka Autonomous Okrug is an exception in that it is not administratively subordinated to any other federal subject of Russia., Okrugs are usually former autonomous okrugs that lost their federal subject status due to a merger with another federal subject., . 
Typical lower-level administrative divisions include:
selsoviets (rural councils), towns and urban-type settlements of the administrative district significance, city districts, .

Main article: Municipal divisions of Russia 
In the course of the Russian municipal reform of 2004a2005, all federal subjects of Russia were to streamline the structures of local self-government, which is guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia. The reform mandated that each federal subject was to have a unified structure of the municipal government bodies by January1, 2005, and a law enforcing the reform provisions went in effect on January1, 2006. According to the law, the units of the municipal division (called " municipal formations ") are as follows: [ 5 ] 
Municipal district , a group of urban and rural settlements, often along with the inter-settlement territories. In practice, municipal districts are usually formed within the boundaries of existing administrative districts ( raions ). Urban settlement , a city/town or an urban-type settlement, possibly together with adjacent rural and/or urban localities, Rural settlement , one or several rural localities, . , Urban okrug , an urban settlement not incorporated into a municipal district. In practice, urban okrugs are usually formed within the boundaries of existing cities of federal subject significance., Intra-urban territory (intra-urban municipal formation) of a federal city , a part of a federal city's territory. In Moscow, these are called municipal formations (which correspond to districts); in St.Petersburga municipal okrugs , towns , and settlements . In Sevastopol (located on the Crimean Peninsula, which is a territory disputed between Russia and Ukraine), they are known as municipal okrugs and a town . [ 6 ] , . 
Territories not included as a part of municipal formations are known as inter-settlement territories .
The Federal Law was amended on May27, 2014 to include new types of municipal divisions: [ 7 ] 
Urban okrug with intra-urban divisions , an urban okrug divided into intra-urban districts at the lower level of the municipal hierarchy, Intra-urban district , a municipal formation within an urban okrug with intra-urban divisions. This municipal formation type would typically be established within the borders of existing city districts (i.e., the administrative divisions in some of the cities of federal subject significance)., . 
In June 2014, Chelyabinsky Urban Okrug became the first urban okrug to implement intra-urban divisions. [ 8 ] 
Other types of subdivisions [ edit ] 
Federal districts [ edit ] 
Main article: Federal districts of Russia Federal districts of Russia 
All of the federal subjects are grouped into nine federal districts , [ 9 ] each administered by an envoy appointed by the President of Russia. Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws.
Economic regions [ edit ] 
Main article: Economic regions of Russia Economic regions of Russia 
For economic and statistical purposes the federal subjects are grouped into twelve economic regions . [ 10 ] Economic regions and their parts sharing common economic trends are in turn grouped into economic zones and macrozones.
Military districts [ edit ] 
Main article: Military districts of Russia Military districts of Russia 
In order for the Armed Forces to provide an efficient management of military units, their training, and other operational activities, the federal subjects are grouped into four military districts . [ 11 ] Each military district operates under the command of the district headquarters, headed by the district commander, and is subordinated to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.
