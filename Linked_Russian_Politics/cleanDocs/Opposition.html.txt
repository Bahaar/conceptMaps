Background and white-ribbon opposition [ edit ] 
Most opposition organizations independent from the Kremlin encounter a draconian law on political parties, refusals of registration by the Justice Ministry, censorship in major mass media, primarily federal TV channels. According to Vladimir Ryzhkov, "over the last 4 years (i.e. from 2007 - Ed.) for identical "formal reason" nine political parties were denied registration - from left to right. And not any new party was registered. In modern Russia, this is not possible". [ 1 ] 
Recently, for the protesters for Fair Elections the term white ribbon opposition has been applied, as they wore white ribbons as their symbol. [ 2 ] 
The White Ribbon "For Russia Without Putin" 
Actions and campaigns of the opposition [ edit ] 
Current campaigns of the opposition:
Dissemination of anti-Putin reports : Putin. Results. 10 years (2010), Putin. Corruption (2011), Life of a Slave on Galleys (2012). Video versions of these reports, entitled Lies of Putinas regime, have been viewed by about 10 million times on the Internet. [ 3 ] , . 
In addition, smaller-scale series of actions are conducted. For example, in Moscow in the spring of 2012 saw a series of flash mobs "White Square", when protesters walked through the Red Square with white ribbons, [ 4 ] in the late spring and summer, they organized the protest camp "Occupy Abay" and autumn they held weekly "Liberty walks" with the chains symbolizing solidarity with political prisoners. [ 5 ] 
A Monstration is a creative parody demonstration [ 6 ] were protesters gently poke fun at Kremlin policies. [ 7 ] 
Participation in elections [ edit ] 
Some opposition figures, for example, Garry Kasparov, said there are no elections in Putin's Russia, [ 8 ] [ 9 ] and that participation in a procedure called elections only legitimizes the regime.
On the other hand, a small part of liberals (the party of "Democratic Choice") consider elections as the main tool to achieve their political goals. [ 10 ] The system opposition also supports participation in elections.
Protests against election fraud [ edit ] 
Main article: 2011a13 Russian protests The rally for fair elections December 10, 2011 at the Bolotnaya Square in Moscow. Luzhkov Bridge with banners "Crooks and thieves, return elections", "Deputies, we have not chosen you!" 
Starting from 5 December 2011, the day after the elections to the State Duma, there have been repeated massive political actions of Russian citizens who disagree with the outcome of these "elections". The current surge of mass opposition rallies has been called in some publications "a snow revolution". [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] These rallies continued during the campaign for the election of the President of Russia and after March 4, 2012 presidential election, in which Putin officially won the first round. The protesters claimed that the elections were accompanied by violations of the election legislation and widespread fraud. One of the main slogans of the majority of actions was "For Fair Elections!" and a white ribbon has been chosen as symbol of protests. Beginning from spring 2012 the actions were called marches of millions and took the form of a march followed by a rally. The speeches of participants were anti-Putin and anti-government.
The "March of Millions" on 6 May 2012 at the approach to Bolotnaya Square was dispersed by the police. In the so-called Bolotnaya square case 17 people are accused of committing violence against police (12 of them are in jail). A large number of human rights defenders and community leaders have declared the detainees innocent and the police responsible for the clashes. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] 
For the rally on December 15, 2012, the anniversary of the mass protests against rigged elections, the organizers failed to agree with the authorities, and participation was low. Several thousand people gathered without placards on Lubyanka Square and laid flowers at the Solovetsky Stone. [ 17 ] 
March for Peace [ edit ]
