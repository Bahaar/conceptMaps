They speak the Bashkir language, which belongs to the Kypchak branch of the Turkic languages.

(August 2012) , The first settlements in the territory of modern Bashkortostan date from the early Paleolithic period, but the Bronze Age spurred an upsurge in the population of this territory. When people of the Abashevo culture started settling here they possessed high skills in manufacturing bronze tools, weapons, and decorations. They were the first to establish permanent settlements in the Southern Urals.
Bashkortostan takes its name from its native people - the Bashkirs. The Russian (Slavonic) name of the country a Bashkiriya a formed at the end of the 16th century. Originally it appeared in the forms Bashkira , Bashkirda and Bashkir horde . The first written references to Bashkir tribes appear in compositions of Herodotus (fifth century BCE). The ethnonym Bashkirs first became known in the 9th century. In the 10th century, Al-Balkhi wrote about Bashkirs as a people, divided into two groups, one of which inhabited the Southern Urals, while the other lived near the Danube river, close to the boundaries of Byzantium. His contemporary Ibn-Ruste described the Bashkirs as "an independent people, occupying territories on both sides of the Ural mountain ridge between Volga, Kama, Tobol and upstream of Yaik river".
After the early-feudal Mongolian state had broken down in the 14th century, the territory of modern Bashkortostan became divided between the Kazan and Siberia Khanates and the Nogai Horde. The tribes that lived there were headed by bi (tribal heads). After Kazan fell to Ivan the Terrible in 1554a1555, representatives of western and northwestern Bashkir tribes approached the Tsar with a request to voluntarily join Muscovy. [ citation needed ] 
Starting from the second half of the 16th century, Bashkiria's territory began taking shape as a part of the Russian state. In 1798 the Spiritual Assembly of Russian Muslims was established [ by whom? ] a an indication that the tsarist Government recognized the rights of Bashkirs, Tatars, and other Muslim nations to profess Islam and perform religious rituals. Ufa Governorate ( guberniya ), with a center in Ufa, was formed in 1865a another step towards territorial identification.
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) was established on March23, 1919; [ 4 ] first as Little Bashkortostan; eventually all of Ufa Governorate became incorporated into the newly established republic. During the Soviet period, Bashkiria was granted broad autonomous rightsa the first among other Russian regions. The administrative structure of the Bashkir ASSR was based on principles similar to those of other autonomous republics of Russia.
The extraction of crude oil in Bashkiria began in 1932. At the end of 1943 large crude oil deposits were discovered. [ by whom? ] During the Great Patriotic War of 1941 to 1945, Bashkiria became one of the major regions of the Soviet Union to accommodate plants and factories evacuated from Western Russia, as well as great masses of people, while also providing the country with weaponry, fuel, and foodstuffs. After the war, a number of industries developed further in Bashkiria , such as mining, machine-building and (especially) oil-refining. Bashkiria's industry became a solid base for the further economic growth of all European outlying territories of Russia.
On October11, 1990 the Supreme Soviet of the Republic adopted the Declaration on state sovereignty of the Bashkir ASSR. On February25, 1992, the Bashkir ASSR was renamed [ by whom? ] the Republic of Bashkortostan.
On March31, 1992, a Federative Compact "On separation of authorities and powers among federal organs of power of the Russian Federation and the organs of power of the Republic of Bashkortostan" was signed. On August3, 1994, a Compact "On separation of authorities and mutual delegating of powers among the organs of power of the Russian Federation and the organs of power of the Republic of Bashkortostan" was signed.

The republic has seven Bashkir, four Russian, and two Tatar State Drama Theaters, a State Opera and Ballet Theater, a National Symphony Orchestra, "Bashkortostan" film studio, thirty philharmonic collectives, and the Bashkir State Folk Dance Ensemble.
The Bashkir School of Dance is well respected [ citation needed ] , with many students receiving international awards at competitions in Russia and other countries.
