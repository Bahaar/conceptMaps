History [ edit ]

Early history [ edit ] 
Earliest archaeological signs of human beings in the area of Mordovia are from the Neolithic era. Finno-Ugric Mordvins are mentioned in written sources in 6th century. Later, Mordvins were under the influence of both Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus. Mordvin princes sometimes raided Muroma and Volga Bulgaria, and often despoiled each other's holdings.
Mongol rule [ edit ] 
The Mongols conquered vast areas of Eastern Europe in the 13th century. They established the khanate of the Golden Horde in 1241, subjugating the area of Mordovia. Mordvins fought against Mongols and later alongside Russians. [ citation needed ] Mordvin lands territorially belonged to Mukhsha Ulus. The Golden Horde disintegrated in 1430s, which resulted in some Mordvins becoming subjects of the Khanate of Kazan, whereas others were incorporated into Muscovy.
Russian rule [ edit ] 
When Ivan IV of Russia annexed the Khanate of Kazan in 1552, the Mordvin lands were subjugated to the Russian tsars. The Mordvin elite rapidly adopted Russian language and customs, whereas 1821 saw the publication of the New Testament in Erzya to address the non-elite population. In rural areas, Mordvin culture was preserved. Russians started to convert Mordvins to Orthodox Christianity in the mid-18th century. Mordvins gave up their own shamanist religion only slowly, however, and many of shamanist features were preserved as parts of local culture though the population became nominally Christian. Translations of literature to Mordvin languages were mostly religious books. In the 18th century, the Latin alphabet was used in writing Mordvin, but from the mid-19th century, Cyrillic was used.
Part of the Soviet Union [ edit ] 
During the Russian revolution and civil war, Mordovia was held mostly by opponents of Bolsheviks. When the Bolsheviks prevailed in the war, Mordovia became a part of the Russian SFSR. In 1925, the Soviet government founded autonomous districts and village councils in the area of the Mordvins. During the Soviet era, two written languages were developed, one based on the Erzya dialect in 1922 and one on the Moksha dialect in 1923, both using Cyrillic script. The Mordovian Okrug was founded on July16, 1928, and it was elevated to the status of an autonomous oblast on January10, 1930. The autonomous oblast was transformed into the Mordovian Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic on December20, 1934. [ 4 ] 
Part of the Russian Federation [ edit ] 
When the Soviet Union disintegrated, the Mordovian ASSR proclaimed itself the Republic of Mordovia in 1990, and remained a part of the Russian Federation. The Republic of Mordovia in its present form has existed since January25, 1994.
Politics [ edit ] 
Seat of the Government, completed in 1986 
The supreme law is the Constitution of the Republic of Mordovia.
In a "wave" of sovereignty common among other former Russian autonomous republics, Mordovia established a presidency in 1991
In that same year, Vasilly Guslyannikov, a physicist by training, was elected in the general election. Guslyannikov had previously been a senior researcher at the Institute of Power Electronics and was the leader of the republican branch of the Democratic Russia political movement.
In 1993, the Supreme Council of Mordovia abolished the post of president, on the basis of what Guslyannikov was removed from his post. Guslyannikov appealed the action of the supreme legislative body of the republic in the Russian Constitutional Court, however, the Constitutional Court declared their conformity with the Constitution of Russia.
The head of the government in the Republic of Mordovia is the Head of the Republic. The office is currently held by the long-time Prime Minister, Vladimir Volkov who was sworn in on May 14, 2012. His predecessor was Nikolay Merkushkin who held the office from 1995 to 2012.
The State Assembly is the legislature of the republic.
Economy [ edit ] 
The most developed industries are machine building, chemical, woodworking, and food industries. Most of the industrial enterprises are located in the capital Saransk, as well as in the towns of Kovylkino and Ruzayevka, and in the urban-type settlements of Chamzinka and Komsomolsky.

Education and sport [ edit ] 
The most important facilities of higher education include Mordovian State University and Mordovian State Pedagogical Institute in Saransk. Mordovia, along with neighbour Chuvashia and Penza Oblast, has given some of the best modern racewalking athletes, both women (Olga Kaniskina, Anisya Kirdyapkina, Elena Lashmanova, Olena Shumkina, Irina Stankina) or men (Sergey Bakulin, Valeriy Borchin, Stanislav Emelyanov, Vladimir Kanaykin, Sergey Kirdyapkin, Sergey Morozov, Denis Nizhegorodov, Roman Rasskazov), apart from Alexei Nemov (see more in the article History of Mordovian sport).
Language [ edit ] 
The Mordvinic languages, [ 22 ] alternatively Mordvin languages, [ 23 ] or Mordvinian languages, (Russian: Mordovskie yazyki , the official Russian term for the language pair) [ 24 ] are a subgroup of the Uralic languages, comprising the closely related Erzya language and Moksha language. [ 25 ] Previously considered a single "Mordvin language", [ 26 ] it is now treated as a small language family. Due to differences in phonology, lexicon, and grammar, Erzya and Moksha are not mutually intelligible, so that the Russian language is often used for intergroup communications. [ 27 ] 
The two Mordvinic languages also have separate literary forms. The Erzya literary language was created in 1922 and the Mokshan in 1923. [ 28 ] 
Phonological differences between the two languages include: [ 26 ] 
Moksha retains a distinction between the vowels /E, e/ while in Erzya, both have merged as /e/ ., In unstressed syllables, Erzya features vowel harmony like many other Uralic languages, using [e] in front-vocalic words and [o] in back-vocalic words. Moksha has a simple schwa [E] in their place., Word-initially, Erzya has a postalveolar affricate /tE/ corresponding to a fricative /E/ in Moksha., Next to voiceless consonants, liquids /r, rE, l, lE/ and the semivowel /j/ are devoiced in Moksha to [rI rIE lI lIE EI] ., . 
The medieval Muromian language may have been Mordvinic, or close to Mordvinic.
