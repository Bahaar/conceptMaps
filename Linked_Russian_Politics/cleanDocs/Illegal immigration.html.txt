Illegal immigration in Russia 
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search 
There are an estimated 4 million illegal immigrants from the ex-Soviet states in Russia. [ 1 ] 
In 2012, the Russian Federal Security Service's Border Service stated there had been an increase in illegal migration from the Middle East and South Asia. [ 2 ] Under legal changes made in 2012, illegal immigrants who are caught will be banned from reentering the country for 10 years. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] 
The problem has become so severe it has caused a rise in Russian nationalism, and spawned groups like Movement Against Illegal Immigration. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
