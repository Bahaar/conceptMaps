Rossiyskaya respublika ; IPA: [rEEsEijskEjE rEEsEpublEEkE] ) was a short-lived polity that controlled, de jure , the territory of the former Russian Empire after the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II on 15 March [O.S. 2 March] 1917. Less than eight months later, the Republic was dissolved after the October Revolution on 7 November [O.S. 25 October] 1917 and the establishment of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR). Officially, the Republic's government was the Provisional Government of Russia (Russian: DNDDDDDDD DNDDDNDDNNNDD DDNNDD), although de facto control was split between the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet.
