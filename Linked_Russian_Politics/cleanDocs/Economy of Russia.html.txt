All values, unless otherwise stated, are in US dollars. , Dconomy of Russia is a high-income mixed economy with state ownership in strategic areas of the economy. Market reforms of the 1990s privatized much of Russian industry and agriculture, with notable exceptions in the energy and defense-related sectors.
Russia is unusual among the major economies in the way it relies on energy revenues to drive growth. The country has an abundance of natural resources, including oil, natural gas and precious metals, which make up a major share of Russia's exports. As of 2012 oil and gas sector accounted for 16f the GDP, 52f federal budget revenues and over 70f total exports. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] 
Russia has a large and sophisticated arms industry, capable of designing and manufacturing high-tech military equipment, including a fifth-generation fighter jet. The value of Russian arms exports totalled $15.7 billion in 2013asecond only to the US. Top military exports from Russia include combat aircraft, air defence systems, ships, submarines. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] 
Russian economy is the sixth largest in the world by PPP. [ 28 ] Between 2000 and 2012, Russia's energy exports fuelled a rapid growth in living standards, with real disposable income rising by 160sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"> [ 29 ] In dollar-denominated terms this amounted to more than sevenfold increase in disposable incomes since 2000. [ 30 ] However, these gains have been distributed unevenly as 110 wealthiest individuals were found to own 35f all financial assets held by Russian households. [ 31 ] Since 2008 Moscow has been repeatedly named the "billionaire capital of the world" by Forbes. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] 
According to the IMF, the Russian economy was already in recession from early 2014 mainly as a result of the 2014 Crimean crisis and the subsequent capital flight. [ 34 ] But this turned out to be false and the IMF revised it's rhetoric to close to being in recession and a forecast of 0.2rowth in 2014 and 1.0hrough 2015. [ 35 ]

Economic history 
Main article: Economic history of the Russian Federation See also: Economy of the Soviet Union 
Soviet economy 
By the 1970s the Soviet Union entered the Era of Stagnation. The complex demands of the modern economy and inflexible administration overwhelmed and constrained the central planners. The volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. The cumbersome procedures for bureaucratic administration foreclosed the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level for dealing with worker alienation, innovation, customers, and suppliers. During 1975a85 coruption and data fiddling became common practice among bureaucracy to report satisfied targets and quotas thus entrenching the crisis. Since 1986 Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to address economic problems by moving towards a market-oriented socialist economy. Gorbachev's policies had failed to rejuvenate the Soviet economy, though. Instead, Perestroika set off a process of political and economic disintegration, culminating in the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Transition to market economy (1991a1998) 
Russian economy since fall of the Soviet Union. 
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia had undergone a radical transformation, moving from a centrally planned economy to a globally integrated market economy. Corrupt and haphazard privatization process turned over major state-owned firms to politically connected "oligarchs", which has left equity ownership highly concentrated.
Yeltsin's program of radical, market-oriented reform came to be known as a "shock therapy". It was based on the recommendations of the IMF and a group of top American economists, including Larry Summers. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The result was disastrous, with real GDP falling by more than 40y 1999, hyperinflation which wiped out personal savings, crime and destitution spreading rapidly. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] 
The majority of state enterprises were privatized amid great controversy and subsequently came to be owned by insiders [ 40 ] for far less than they were worth. [ 36 ] For example, the director of a factory during the Soviet regime would often become the owner of the same enterprise. Under the government's cover, outrageous financial manipulations were performed that enriched a narrow group of individuals at key positions of business and government. [ 41 ] Many of them promptly invested their newfound wealth abroad producing an enormous capital flight. [ 42 ] 
Difficulties in collecting government revenues amid the collapsing economy and a dependence on short-term borrowing to finance budget deficits led to a 1998 Russian financial crisis.
Recovery and growth (1999a2008) 
Oil prices in the 2000s 
Russia bounced back from the August 1998 financial crash with surprising speed. Much of the reason for the recovery was devaluation of the ruble, which made domestic producers more competitive nationally and internationally.
The three years from 2000 to 2002 were characterized by pro-growth economic reforms including a comprehensive tax reform, which introduced a flat income tax of 13and a broad effort at deregulation which improved the situation for small and medium-sized enterprises. [ 43 ] 
Between 2000 and 2008, Russian economy got a major boost from rising commodity prices. GDP grew on average 7er year. [ 38 ] [ 44 ] Disposable incomes more than doubled and in dollar-denominated terms increased eightfold. [ 30 ] The volume of consumer credit between 2000a2006 increased 45 times, fuelling a boom in private consumption. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] The number of people living below poverty line declined from 30n 2000 to 14n 2008. [ 44 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] 
Inflation remained a problem however, as the central bank aggressively expanded money supply to combat appreciation of the ruble. [ 49 ] Nevertheless, in 2007 the World Bank declared that the Russian economy achieved "unprecedented macroeconomic stability". [ 50 ] Until October 2007, Russia maintained impressive fiscal discipline with budget surpluses every year from 2000. [ 43 ] 
2009apresent 
See also: Great Recession in Russia 
Russian banks were hit by the global credit crunch in 2008, though no long term damage was done thanks to proactive and timely response by the government and central bank, which shielded the banking system from effects of the global financial crisis. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] A sharp, but brief recession was followed by a strong recovery beginning in late 2009. [ 38 ] 
After 16 years of negotiations, Russia's membership to the WTO was accepted in 2011. [ 54 ] In 2013, Russia was labeled a high-income economy by the World Bank. [ 55 ] 
Russian leaders repeatedly spoke of the need to diversify the economy away from its dependence on oil and gas and foster a high-technology sector. [ 56 ] In 2012 oil, gas and petroleum products accounted for over 70f total exports. [ 25 ] This economic model appeared to show its limits, when after years of strong performance, Russian economy expanded by a mere 1.3n 2013. [ 38 ] Several reasons have been proposed to explain the slowdown, including prolonged recession in the EU, which is Russia's largest trading partner, stagnant oil prices, lack of spare industrial capacity and demographic problems. [ 57 ] Political turmoil in neighboring Ukraine added to the uncertainty and suppressed investment.
According to the IMF, the Russian economy was already in recession from early 2014, mainly as a result of the 2014 Crimean crisis and the subsequent capital flight. [ 58 ] But this turned out to be false and the IMF revised it's rhetoric to close to being in recession and a forecast of 0.2rowth in 2014 and 1.0hrough 2015. [ 59 ] 
According to the Russian economic ministry, GDP growth in the first half of 2014 was 1The ministry expects growth of 0.5or the entire 2014. [ 60 ]

Currency and central bank 
Main articles: Russian ruble and Bank of Russia Official ruble sign 
Russian ruble is the unit of currency of the Russian Federation. It is also accepted as legal tender in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Russian monetary system is managed by the Bank of Russia. Founded on 13 July 1990 as the State Bank of the RSFSR, Bank of Russia assumed responsibilities of the central bank following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. [ 62 ] 
According to the Donstitution, Bank of Russia is an independent entity, with the primary responsibility of protecting the stability of the national currency, the ruble. It is also chief regulator and a lender of last resort for the banking industry in Russia. Bank of Russia is governed by a board of directors, headed by a governor who is appointed by the President of Russia. [ 63 ] 
Large current account surpluses caused rapid real appreciation of the ruble between 2000 and 2008. Bank of Russia attempted to combat this trend by aggressively accumulating foreign currency reserves. This was a major contributing cause to relatively high inflation rates during this period. Central bank policy evolved following the global financial crisis. Instead of targeting a fixed exchange rate vs a basket of dollar and euro, Bank of Russia shifted its focus to inflation targeting. [ 49 ] [ 64 ] In April 2012 Russian inflation reached record low of 3.6sup id="cite_ref-Record_low_Russian_inflation_65-0" class="reference"> [ 65 ] 
The Russian Central Bank has been planning to free float the Russian Ruble and has been widening the currency's trading band and expects the ruble to be fully free floating in 2015. However, the ruble has fell significantly since 2013 when the central bank announced the plans. On October 3, 2014 the USD-RUB exchange reached 40.00 Russian Rubles to USD, up from 32.19 Rubles the same time last year, this represents a decline of 24.26The Russian Central bank has stated that Russian banks are able to withstand a devaluation of up to 250n January 2014 when the Ruble has just began its decline, therefore Central Bank intervention may be needed, however plans to free float the currency are still ongoing. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] 
Along with a rapid devaluation of the Ruble inflation in Russia has greatly increased. In 2012 Inflation was at one of its lowest points since the fall of the Soviet Union at 3.6in October 2014 the rate of inflation was reported to be 8although this is well below the 2333.30nflation rate experienced in 1992. [ 68 ] 
Public policy 
Fiscal policy 
See also: Federal budget of Russia 
Central and local government expenditures are about equal. Combined they come to about 38f GDP. Fiscal policy has been very disciplined since the 1998 debt crisis. The overall budget surplus for 2001 was 2.4f GDP, allowing for the first time in history for the next year's budget to be calculated with a surplus (1.63f GDP). Much of this growth, which exceeded most expectations for the third consecutive year, was driven by consumption demand. Analysts remain skeptical that high rates of economic growth will continue, particularly since Russia's planned budgets through 2005 assume that oil prices will steadily increase. Low oil prices would mean that the Russian economy would not achieve its projected growth. However, high oil prices also would have negative economic effects, as they would cause the ruble to continue to appreciate and make Russian exports less competitive. The 2007 budget law incorporates a 25ncrease in spending, much of it for public-sector salary increases, pension increases and social work. Spending on education is targeted to increase by 60based on 2006 legislation, and spending on healthcare is to increase by 30Funding for the four "national projects", undertakings in agriculture, education, housing and healthcare, will increase by 85billion rubles over the 2006 figure to 230billion rubles. [ citation needed ] 
National wealth fund 
On 1 January 2004, the Stabilization fund of the Russian Federation was established by the Government of Russia as a part of the federal budget to balance it if oil price falls. Now the Stabilization fund of the Russian Federation is being modernized. Stabilization Fund of the Russian Federation will be divided into two parts on 1 February 2008. The first part will become a reserve fund equal to 10f GDP (10f GDP equals to about $200billion now), and will be invested in a similar way as Stabilization Fund of the Russian Federation. The second part will be turned into the National Prosperity Fund of Russian Federation. Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak estimates it will reach 600a700billion rubles by 1 February 2008. The National Prosperity Fund is to be invested into more risky instruments, including the shares of foreign companies. [ 69 ] 
Public debt 
Russian public debt 
As a chief successor state to the Soviet Union, Russia took up the responsibility for paying USSR's external debts. [ 70 ] 
In the June 2002 G8 summit, leaders of the eight nations signed a statement agreeing to explore cancellation of some of Russia's old Soviet debt to use the savings for safeguarding materials in Russia that could be used by terrorists. Under the proposed deal, $10billion would come from the United States and $10billion from other G-8 countries over 10 years. [ citation needed ] 
Strategic sectors and enterprises 
In the Russian law, there are sectors of the economy which are considered to be crucial for national security and foreign companies are restricted from owning them. Investments in the so-called Strategic Sectors are defined in a law adopted by the Federal Assembly of Russia. Strategic enterprises are a list of state owned corporations which privatization and new share issues of require explicit approval of the President. It began with a Presidential Decree with list of more than 1000 state owned firms dated from 2004, which was amended several times.
Sectors 
In Russia, services are the biggest sector of the economy and account for 58f GDP. Within services the most important segments are: wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal and household goods (17f total GDP); public administration, health and education (12 real estate (9and transport storage and communications (7 Industry contributes 40o total output. Mining (11f GDP), manufacturing (13and construction (4are the most important industry segments. Agriculture accounts for the remaining 2/p>

Energy 
Oil and natural gas pipelines in Europe 
The mineral-packed Ural Mountains and the vast oil, gas, coal, and timber reserves of Siberia and the Russian Far East make Russia rich in natural resources, which dominate Russian exports. Oil and gas exports, specifically, continue to be the main source of hard currency.
The petroleum industry in Russia is one of the largest in the world. Russia has the largest reserves, and is the largest exporter, of natural gas. It has the second largest coal reserves, the eighth largest oil reserves, and is the largest exporter of oil in the world in absolute numbers. [ citation needed ] Per capita oil production in Russia, though, is not that high. As of 2007, Russia was producing 69.603 bbl/day per 1, 000 people, much less than Canada (102.575 bbl/day), Saudi Arabia (371.363 bbl/day), or Norway (554.244 bbl/day), but more than two times the USA (28.083 bbl/day) or the UK (27.807 bbl/day). [ 72 ] 
Mining 
Russia is also a leading producer and exporter of minerals and gold. 90f Russian exports to the United States are minerals or other raw materials. [ citation needed ] Russia is the largest diamond-producing nation in the world, estimated to produce over 33 million carats in 2013, or 25f global output valued at over $3.4 billion, with state-owned ALROSA accounting for approximately 95f all Russian production. [ 73 ] 
Expecting the area to become more accessible as climate change melts Arctic ice, and believing the area contains large reserves of untapped oil and natural gas, Russian explorers on 2 August 2007 in submersibles planted the Russian flag on the Arctic seabed, staking a claim to energy sources right up to the North Pole. Reaction to the event was mixed: President Vladimir Putin congratulated the explorers for "the outstanding scientific project", while Canadian officials stated the expedition was just a public show. [ 74 ] 
Under the Federal Law " On Continental Shelf Development " upon proposal from the federal agency managing the state fund of mineral resources, or its territorial offices, the Russian government approves the list of some sections of the mineral resources that are passed for development without any contests and auctions, some sections of federal importance of the Russian continental shelf, some sections of the mineral resources of federal importance that are situated in Russia and stretch out on its continental shelf, some gas deposits of federal importance that are handed over for prospecting and developing mineral resources under a joint license. The Russian government is also empowered to decide on the handover of the previously mentioned sections of the mineral resources for development without any contests and auctions.
Fishing and forestry 
Main article: Forestry in Russia 
The Russian fishing industry is the world's fourth-largest, behind Japan, the United States, and China. [ citation needed ] 
Russia has more than a fifth of the world's forests, which makes it the largest forest country in the world. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] However, according to a 2012 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the government of the Russian Federation, [ 77 ] the considerable potential of Russian forests is underutilized and Russia's share of the global trade in forest products is less than 4sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"> [ 78 ] [ 79 ] 
Agriculture 
Main article: Agriculture in Russia 
Russia comprises roughly three-quarters of the territory of the former Soviet Union. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 and after nearly 10 years of decline, Russian agriculture began to show signs of improvement due to organizational and technological modernization. Northern areas concentrate mainly on livestock, and the southern parts and western Siberia produce grain. The restructuring of former state farms has been an extremely slow process. The new land code passed by the Duma in 2002 should speed restructuring and attract new domestic investment to Russian agriculture. Private farms and garden plots of individuals account for over one-half of all agricultural production. [ citation needed ] 
Industry 
Russia's industrial growth per year ( 1992a2010 
Industrial Production in Russia decreased 2.10n February 2013 over the same month in the previous year. Industrial Production in Russia is reported by the Federal State Statistics Service. Historically, from 2006 until 2013, Russia Industrial Production averaged 2.82eaching an all-time high of 12.60n May 2010 and a record low of a16.90n January 2009. In Russia, industrial production measures the output of businesses integrated in industrial sector of the economy such as manufacturing, mining, and utilities. Russia is one of the most industrialized of the former Soviet republics. In the 2000s, Russia's industry, due to increasing demand and improved state finances, emerged from a deep crisis caused by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, years of low investment continue to leave their mark on the industry's capabilities and a lot of its equipment is in need of modernization. [ citation needed ] 
Besides its resource-based industries, Russia has developed large manufacturing capacities, notably in machinery. The defense and aircraft industries are important employers and are able to offer internationally competitive products for export. [ citation needed ] 
Defense industry 
Main article: Defense industry of Russia 
Russia's defense industry employs 2.5a 3million people, accounting for 20f all manufacturing jobs. [ 80 ] Russia is the world's second largest conventional arms exporter after the United States. [ 81 ] The most popular types of weaponry bought from Russia are Sukhoi and MiG fighters, air defense systems, helicopters, battle tanks, armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles. [ 81 ] The research organization Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies ranked the air defense system producer Almaz-Antey as the industry's most successful company in 2007, followed by aircraft-maker Sukhoi. Almaz-Antey's revenue that year was $3.122billion, and it had a work force of 81, 857 people. [ 82 ] 
Aerospace 
Main articles: Aircraft industry of Russia and Space industry of Russia The Sukhoi Superjet 100 is Russia's most recent civilian aviation product of its industry. The regional passenger plane was ordered around 280 times for various airlines and leasing companies. 
Aircraft manufacturing is an important industry sector in Russia, employing around 355, 300 people. The Russian aircraft industry offers a portfolio of internationally competitive military aircraft such as MiG-29 and Su-30, while new projects such as the Sukhoi Superjet 100 are hoped to revive the fortunes of the civilian aircraft segment. In 2009, companies belonging to the United Aircraft Corporation delivered 95 new fixed-wing aircraft to its customers, including 15 civilian models. In addition, the industry produced over 141 helicopters. It is one of the most science-intensive hi-tech sectors and employs the largest number of skilled personnel. The production and value of the military aircraft branch far outstrips other defense industry sectors, and aircraft products make up more than half of the country's arms exports. [ 83 ] 
Space industry of Russia consists of over 100 companies and employs 250, 000 people. [ 84 ] The largest company of the industry is RKK Energia, the main manned space flight contractor. Leading launch vehicle producers are Khrunichev and TsSKB Progress. Largest satellite developer is Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems, while NPO Lavochkin is the main developer of interplanetary probes. [ citation needed ] 
Automotive industry

Automobile production is a significant industry in Russia, directly employing around 600, 000 people or 0.7f the country's total work force. In addition, the industry supports around 2a3million people in related industries. Russia was the world's 15th largest car producer in 2010, and accounts for about 7f the worldwide production. In 2009 the industry produced 595, 807 light vehicles, down from 1, 469, 898 in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. The largest companies are light vehicle producers AvtoVAZ and GAZ, while KAMAZ is the leading heavy vehicle producer. 11 foreign carmakers have production operations or are constructing plants in Russia.

Russia is experiencing a regrowth of microelectronics, with the revival of JCS Mikron. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] An example of a successful Russian consumer electronics company is Telesystems, whose products are sold in over 20 countries. [ citation needed ] 
Services 
Retail 
As of 2013, Russians spent 60f their pre-tax income shopping, the highest percentage in Europe. This is possible because many Russians pay no rent or house payments, owning their own home after privatization of state-owned Soviet housing. Shopping malls were popular with international investors and shoppers from the emerging middle class. 82 malls had been built near major cities including a few that were very large. A supermarket selling groceries is a typical anchor store in a Russian mall. [ 87 ]

A significant drawback for investment is the banking sector, which lacks the resources, the capability, and the trust of the population that it would need to attract substantial savings and direct it toward productive investments. Russia's banks contribute only about 3f overall investment in Russia. While ruble lending has increased since the August 1998 financial crisis, loans are still only 40f total bank assets. The Central Bank of Russia reduced its refinancing rate five times in 2000, from 55o 25signaling its interest in lower lending rates. Interest on deposits and loans are often below the inflation rate. The poorly developed banking system makes it difficult for entrepreneurs to raise capital and to diversify risk. Banks still perceive commercial lending as risky, and some banks are inexperienced with assessing credit risk. [ citation needed ] 
Money on deposit with Russian banks represents only 7f GDP. Sberbank receives preferential treatment from the state and holds 73f all bank deposits. In March 2002, Sergei Ignatyev replaced Viktor Gerashchenko as Chairman of the Russian Central Bank. Under his leadership, necessary banking reforms, including stricter accounting procedures and federal deposit insurance, were implemented. [ citation needed ] 
Telecommunications

Russia's telecommunications industry is growing in size and maturity. As of 31 December 2007, there were an estimated 4, 900, 000 broadband lines in Russia. [ 89 ] Over 72f the broadband lines were via cable modems and the rest via DSL. [ citation needed ] 
In 2006, there were more than 300 BWA operator networks, accounting for 5f market share, with dial-up accounting for 30and Broadband Fixed Access accounting for the remaining 65sup id="cite_ref-ICT_in_Russia_90-0" class="reference"> [ 90 ] In December 2006, Tom Phillips, chief government and regulatory affairs officer of the GSM Association stated:
"Russia has already achieved more than 100obile penetration thanks to the huge popularity of wireless communications among Russians and the government's good work in fostering a market driven mobile sector based on strong competition." [ 91 ] 
The financial crisis, which had already hit the country at the end of 2008, caused a sharp reduction of the investments by the business sectors and a notable reduction of IT budget made by government in 2008a2009. As a consequence, in 2009 the IT market in Russia declined by more than 20n ruble terms and by one third in euro terms. Among the particular segments, the biggest share of the Russian IT market still belongs to hardware. [ 92 ]

Main articles: Transport in Russia and Russian Railways 
Russian Railways accounts for 2.5up id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"> [ 93 ] of Russia's GDP. The percentage of freight and passenger traffic that goes by rail is unknown, since no statistics are available for private transportation such as private automobiles or company-owned trucks. In 2007, about 1.3 billion passengers [ 94 ] and 1.3 billion tons of freight [ 95 ] went via Russian Railways. In 2007 the company owned 19, 700 [ citation needed ] goods and passenger locomotives, 24, 200 passenger cars (carriages) (2007) and 526, 900 freight cars (goods wagons) (2007). [ 96 ] A further 270, 000 freight cars in Russia are privately owned [ citation needed ] . In 2009 Russia had 128, 000kilometres of common-carrier railroad line, of which about half was electrified and carried most of the traffic; over 40as double track or better. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] 
Construction 
In 2009 the Russian construction industry survived its most difficult year in more than a decade. The 0.8eduction recorded by the industry for the first three quarters of 2010 looked remarkably healthy in comparison with the 18.4lump recorded the previous year, and construction firms became much more optimistic about the future than in previous months. The most successful construction firms concluded contracts worth billions of dollars an planned to take on employees and purchase new building machinery. The downturn served to emphasise the importance of the government to the construction market. [ 99 ] 
Insurance 
Main article: Insurance in Russia 
According to the Central Bank of Russia 422 insurance companies operate on the Russian insurance market by the end of 2013. The concentration of insurance business is significant across all major segments except compulsory motor third party liability market (CMTPL), as the Top 10 companies in 2013 charged 58.1remiums in total without compulsory health insurance (CHI). [ 100 ] Russian insurance market in 2013 demonstrated quite significant rate of growth in operations. Total amount of premiums charged (without CHI) in 2013 is RUB 904.9 bln (increase on 11.8ompared to 2012), total amount of claims paid is RUB 420.8 bln (increase on 13.9ompared to 2012). Premiums to GDP ratio (total without CHI) in 2013 increased to 1.36ompared to 1.31 a year before. The share of premiums in household spending increased to 1.39Level of claims paid on the market total without CHI is 46.5insufficient increase compared to 2012. The number of polices in 2013 increased on 0.1ompared to 2012, to 139.6 mln policies.
Although relative indicators of the Russian insurance market returned to pre-crisis levels, the progress is achieved mainly by the increase of life insurance and accident insurance, the input of these two market segments in premium growth in 2013 largely exceeds their share on the market. As before, life insurance and accident insurance are often used by banks as an appendix to a credit contract protecting creditors from the risk of credit default in case of borroweras death or disability. The rise of these lines is connected, evidently, with the increase in consumer loans, as the total sum of credit obligations of population in 2013 increased on 28o RUB 9.9 trillion. At the same time premium to GDP ratio net of life and accident insurance remained at the same level of 1.1s in 2012. Thus, if "banking" lines of business are excluded, Russian insurance market is in stagnation stage for the last four years, as premiums to GDP ratio net of life and accident insurance remains at the same level of 1.1ince 2010.

Information technology 
Russia has more academic graduates than any other country in Europe. (And world leader in percentage of population with associate's degree or higher: 54compared to 31n UK [ 102 ] ) 
The IT market is one of the most dynamic sectors of the Russian economy. Russian software exports have risen from just $120million in 2000 to $3.3billion in 2010. [ 103 ] Since the year 2000 the IT market has started growth rates of 30a40 year, growing by 54n 2006 alone. The biggest sector in terms of revenue is system and network integration, which accounts for 28.3f the total market revenues. [ 104 ] Meanwhile the fastest growing segment of the IT market is offshore programming.
Currently Russia controls 3f the offshore software development market and is the third leading country (after India and China) among software exporters [ citation needed ] . Such growth of software outsourcing in Russia is caused by a number of factors. One of them is the supporting role of the Russian Government. The government has launched a program promoting construction of IT-oriented technology parks (Technoparks)aspecial zones that have an established infrastructure and enjoy a favorable tax and customs regime, in seven different places around the country: Moscow, Novosibirsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Kaluga, Tumen, Republic of Tatarstan and St. Peterburg Regions. Another factor stimulating the IT sector growth in Russia is the presence of global technology corporations such as Intel, Google, Motorola, Sun Microsystems, Boeing, Nortel, Hewlett-Packard, SAP AG, and others, which have intensified their software development activities and opened their R and D centers in Russia. [ 103 ] 
Under a government decree signed On June 2013, a special "roadmap" is expected to ease business suppliersa access to the procurement programs of state-owned infrastructure monopolies, including such large ones as Gazprom, Rosneft, Russian Railways, Rosatom, and Transneft. These companies will be expected to increase the proportion of domestic technology solutions they use in their operations. The decree puts special emphasis on purchases of innovation products and technologies. According to the new decree, by 2015, government-connected companies must double their purchases of Russian technology solutions compared to the 2013 level and their purchasing levels must quadruple by 2018.

External trade and investment 
Trade 
Share of Russia's exports in 2013 according to the ITC. As can be seen the US market for Russia is on Africa Levels significance thanks to failed US Policies and the delay of Russia joining the WTO. Russia is the most independent G20 country when it comes to dealing with US Foreign Policy. Russian current account due to trade surplus 
Russia recorded a trade surplus of 17742 USD million in January 2013. Balance of trade in Russia is reported by the Central Bank of Russia. Historically, from 1997 until 2013, Russia balance of trade averaged 8338.23 USD million reaching an all-time high of 20647 USD million in December 2011 and a record low of a185 USD million in February 1998. Russia runs regular trade surpluses primarily due to exports of commodities. Russia main exports are oil and natural gas (58f total exports), nickel, palladium, iron and chemical products. Others include: cars, military equipment and timber. Russia imports food, ground transports, pharmaceuticals and textile and footwear. Main trading partners are: China (7f total exports and 10f imports), Germany (7f exports and 8f imports) and Italy. This page includes a chart with historical data for Russia balance of trade. Exports in Russia decreased to 39038 USD million in January 2013 from 48568 USD million in December 2012. Exports in Russia is reported by the Central Bank of Russia. Historically, from 1994 until 2013, Russia Exports averaged 18668.83 USD million reaching an all-time high of 51338 USD million in December 2011 and a record low of 4087 USD million in January 1994. Russia is the fifth-largest economy in the world and is a leading exporter of oil and natural gas. In Russia, services are the biggest sector of the economy and account for 58f GDP. Within services the most important segments are: wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal and household goods (17f total GDP); public administration, health and education (12 real estate (9and transport storage and communications (7 Industry contributes 40o total output.

In 1999, exports were up slightly, while imports slumped by 30.5As a consequence, the trade surplus ballooned to $33.2billion, more than double the previous year's level. In 2001, the trend shifted, as exports declined while imports increased. World prices continue to have a major effect on export performance, since commodities, particularly oil, natural gas, metal, and the timber comprise 80f Russian exports. Ferrous metals exports suffered the most in 2001, declining by 7.5On the import side, steel and grains dropped by 11nd 61respectively. [ citation needed ] 
Most analysts predicted that these trade trends would continue to some extent in 2002. In the first quarter of 2002, import expenditures were up 12increased by goods and a rapid rise of travel expenditure. The combination of import duties, a 20alue-added tax and excise taxes on imported goods (especially automobiles, alcoholic beverages, and aircraft) and an import licensing regime for alcohol still restrain demand for imports. Frequent and unpredictable changes in customs regulations also have created problems for foreign and domestic traders and investors. In March 2002, Russia placed a ban on poultry from the United States. In the first quarter of 2002, exports were down 10s falling income from goods exports was partly compensated for by rising services exports, a trend since 2000. The trade surplus decreased to $7billion from well over $11billion the same period last year. [ citation needed ] 
Russian exports in 2006 
Foreign trade rose 34o $151.5billion in the first half of 2005, mainly due to the increase in oil and gas prices which now form 64f all exports by value.

China's export of machinery and electronic goods to Russia grew 70which is 24f China's total export to Russia in the first 11 months of 2005. During the same time, China's export of high-tech products to Russia increased by 58and that is 7f China's total exports to Russia. Also in this time period border trade between the two countries reached $5.13billion, growing 35nd accounting for nearly 20f the total trade. Most of China's exports to Russia remain apparel and footwear. [ citation needed ] 
Russia is China's eighth largest trade partner and China is now Russia's fourth largest trade partner. [ citation needed ] 
China now has over 750 investment projects in Russia, involving $1.05billion. [ citation needed ] China's contracted investment in Russia totaled $368million during JanuaryaSeptember 2005, twice that in 2004. [ citation needed ] 
Chinese imports from Russia are mainly those of energy sources, such as crude oil, which is mostly transported by rail, and electricity exports from neighboring Siberian and Far Eastern regions. Exports of both of these commodities are increasing, as Russia opened the Eastern SiberiaaPacific Ocean oil pipeline's branch to China, and Russian power companies are building some of its hydropower stations with a view of future exports to China. [ citation needed ] Despite all this Russia still exports more to China by amount of 21.23 billion US dollars in comparison to an import of 17.52 Billions in 2009.

In 1999, investment increased by 4.5the first such growth since 1990. Investment growth has continued at high rates from a very low base, with an almost 30ncrease in total foreign investments in 2001 compared to the previous year. Higher retained earnings, increased cash transactions, the positive outlook for sales, and political stability have contributed to these favorable trends. Foreign investment in Russia is very low. Cumulative investment from U.S. sources of about $4billion are about the same as U.S. investment in Costa Rica. Over the medium-to-long term, Russian companies that do not invest to increase their competitiveness will find it harder either to expand exports or protect their recent domestic market gains from higher quality imports.

Foreign direct investment, which includes contributions to starting capital and credits extended by foreign co-owners of enterprises, rose slightly in 1999 and 2000, but decreased in 2001 by about 10Foreign portfolio investment, which includes shares and securities, decreased dramatically in 1999, but has experienced significant growth since then. In 2001, foreign portfolio investment was $451million, more than twice the amount from the previous year. Inward foreign investment during the 1990s was dwarfed by Russian capital flight, estimated at about $15billion annually. During the years of recovery following the 1998 debt crisis, capital flight seems to have slowed. Inward investment from Cyprus and Gibraltar, two important channels for capital flight from Russia in recent years, suggest that some Russian money is returning home. [ citation needed ]
