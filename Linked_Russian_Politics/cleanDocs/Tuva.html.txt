The Tyva Republic (Russian: DDNDNIDDDDD DNDDI , tr. Respublika Tyva ; IPA: [rEEEspublEEkE tEEva] ; Tuvan: DNDD DDNDNDDDDD , Tyva Respublika ), or Tuva (Russian: DNDDI ), is a federal subject of Russia (a republic, also defined in the Constitution of the Russian Federation as a State [ 12 ] ). It lies in the geographical center of Asia, in southern Siberia. The republic borders with the Altai Republic, the Republic of Khakassia, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Irkutsk Oblast, and the Republic of Buryatia in Russia and with Mongolia to the south. Its capital is the city of Kyzyl. Population: 307, 930 (2010 Census). [ 7 ] 
Forests, mountains, and steppe make up a large part of the geography.
A majority of the people are Tuvans, but Russian is also spoken extensively. Tuva is governed by the Great Khural which elects a chairman for a four-year term. The current chairman is Sholban Kara-ool.

History [ edit ] 
Main article: History of Tuva See also: History of the Tuvan People Map of the Tuva Republic 
The Xiongnu Empire (209 BC-93 CE) governed the territory of modern Tuva. The identity of the ethnic core of Xiongnu has been a subject of varied hypotheses. Proposals by scholars include Mongolic and Turkic. Tatar Mongols lived in Tuva and they moved to Lake Hulun. [ 13 ] The Oirat Mongols lived in eastern Tuva and they moved to the south. [ 14 ] 
The territory of Tuva has been ruled by the Mongolic Xianbei state (93-234), Rouran Khaganate (330-555), Mongol Empire (1206-1368), Northern Yuan (1368-1691), Khotgoid Khanate and Zunghar Khanate (1634-1758). [ 14 ] The historic region of Tannu Uriankhai, of which Tuva is a part, was controlled by the Mongols from 1207 to 1758, when it was brought under Manchu rule (Qing Dynasty until 1911).
During the 1911 revolution in China, tsarist Russia formed a separatist movement among the Tuvans. Tsar Nicholas II ordered Russian troops into Tuva in 1912, as Russian settlers were allegedly being attacked [ citation needed ] . Tuva became nominally independent as the Urjanchai Republic before being brought under Russian protectorate as Uryankhay Kray under Tsar Nicholas II on 17 April 1914. This move was apparently requested by a number of prominent Tuvans, including the High Lama, although it is possible they were actually acting under the coercion of Russian soldiers [ citation needed ] . A Tuvan capital was established, called Belotsarsk (DDDDNDINND; literally, "(Town) of the White Tsar"). Meanwhile, in 1911, Mongolia became independent, though under Russian protection.
Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 which ended the imperial autocracy, most of Tuva was occupied from 5July 1918 to 15July 1919 by Aleksandr Kolchak's "White" Russian troops. Pyotr Ivanovich Turchaninov was named governor of the territory. In the autumn of 1918 the southwestern part was occupied by Chinese troops and the southern part by Mongol troops led by Khatanbaatar Magsarjav. [ citation needed ] From July 1919 to February 1920 the communist Red Army controlled Tuva, but from 19 February 1920 to June 1921 it was occupied by China (governor was Yan Shichao [traditional, WadeaGiles transliteration: Yan Shi-ch'ao]).
On August14, 1921 the Bolsheviks established a Tuvan People's Republic, popularly called Tannu-Tuva . In 1926, the capital (Belotsarsk; Khem-Beldyr since 1918) was renamed Kyzyl, meaning "red". Tuva was de jure an independent state between the World Wars. The state's first ruler, Prime Minister Donduk, sought to strengthen ties with Mongolia and establish Buddhism as the state religion. This unsettled the Kremlin, which orchestrated a coup carried out in 1929 by five young Tuvan graduates of Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the East. In 1930 the pro-Soviet region discarded the state's Mongol script in favor of a Latin alphabet designed for Tuva by Russian linguists, and in 1943 Cyrillic script replaced the Latin. Under the leadership of Party Secretary Salchak Toka, ethnic Russians were granted full citizenship rights and Buddhist and Mongol influences on the Tuvan state and society were systematically reduced. [ 15 ] 
The Soviet Union annexed Tuva outright in 1944, with the approval of Tuva's Little Khural (parliament). The exact circumstances surrounding Tannu-Tuva's incorporation into the USSR in 1944 remain obscure. Salchak Toka, the leader of Tuvan communists, was given the title of First Secretary of the Tuvan Communist Party, and became the de facto ruler of Tuva until his death in 1973. Tuva was made the Tuvan Autonomous Oblast and then became the Tuva ASSR on October10, 1961.
Russian President Vladimir Putin in Tuva 
In February 1990, the Tuvan Democratic Movement was founded by Kaadyr-ool Bicheldei, a philologist at Kyzyl University. The party aimed to provide jobs and housing (both were in short supply), and also to improve the status of Tuvan language and culture. Later on in the year there was a wave of attacks against Tuva's sizeable Russian community, resulting in 88 deaths. Russian troops eventually were called in. Many Russians moved out of the republic during this period. To this day, Tuva remains remote and difficult to access. [ 16 ] 
Tuva was a signatory to the March 31, 1992 treaty that created the Russian Federation. A new constitution for the republic was drawn up on October 22, 1993. This created a 32-member parliament (Supreme Khural) and a Grand Khural, which is responsible for foreign policy and any possible changes to the constitution, and ensures that Tuvan law is given precedence. The constitution also allowed for a referendum if Tuva ever sought independence. This constitution was passed by 53.9or 62.2according to source) of Tuvans in a referendum on December12, 1993. [ 17 ] At the same time, the official name was changed from Tuva (DNDD) to Tyva (DNDD).

Ethnic groups [ edit ] 
According to the 2010 Census, [ 7 ] Tuvans make up 82.0f the republic's population. Other groups include Russians (16.3 and a host of smaller groups, each accounting for less than 0.5f the total population.

It is estimated that the proportion of ethnicities in this group is the same as that of the declared group. [ 22 ] , As can be seen above, during the period 1959-2010 there has been more than a doubling of ethnic Tuvans. The Russian population growth slowed by the 1980s and decreased by 50ince 1989.
Official languages are Tuvan (Turkic) and Russian (Slavic). Outside Kyzyl, settlements have few if any Russian inhabitants and in general Tuvans use their original language as their first language. However, there is a small population of Old believers in the republic scattered in some of the most isolated areas. Before the Soviet rule, there were a number of large ethnic Russian old believer villages, but as the atheist ideology crept in, the believers moved deeper and deeper into the Taiga in order to avoid contact with outsiders. Major Old believer villages are Erzhei, Uzhep, Unzhei, Zhivei and Bolee Malkiye (all in the Kaa-Khemsky District). Smaller ultra-Orthodox settlements are found further upstream. [ 23 ] 
Ethnic Russians make up 38.68f the population (as of 2002 Census) in Kaa-Khemsky District, one of the most remote regions in Tyva. The population is mostly Old believers. [ 24 ] Russians account for 34.12f the population in Piy-Khemsky and 19.80n Todzhinsky. In Kyzyl, they account for 37.02/p> 
Tuvans are closely related ethnically and linguistically to the Khakas to their north and the Altai to their west, but closer culturally to the Mongolians to their south and the related Buryats to their east, with whom they share their Tibetan Buddhism.
Religion [ edit ] 
Religion in Tuva (2012) [ 25 ] [ 26 ] 
Buddhism (61.8/div> Tengrism and unorganised shamanism (8/div> Orthodox (1.5/div> Protestantism (1/div> Atheist and non-religious (12/div> Spiritual but not religious (8/div> Other and undeclared (7.7/div> 
Two religions are widespread among the people of Tuva: Tibetan Buddhism and shamanism. Tibetan Buddhism's present-day spiritual leader is Tenzin Gyatso, the fourteenth Dalai Lama. In September 1992, the fourteenth Dalai Lama visited Tuva for three days. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] On September20, he blessed and consecrated the new yellow-blue-white flag of Tuva, which had just been officially adopted three days previously. [ 29 ] 
The Tuvan people - along with the Yellow Uyghurs in China - are one of the only two Turkic groups who are mainly adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, combined with native shamanism. [ 30 ] 
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Tibetan Buddhism gained increasing popularity in Tuva. An increasing number of new and restored temples are coming into use, as well as novices being trained as monks and lamas. Religious practice declined under the restrictive policies of the Soviet period but is now flourishing. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Shamanism is being revived as well, also in organised Tengrian forms.
As of a 2012 official survey [ 25 ] 61.8f the population of Tuva adheres to Buddhism, 8o Tengrism or Tuvan shamanism, 1.5o the Russian Orthodox Church, Starovery or other forms of Christianity, 1o Protestantism. In addition, 7.7ollows other religion or did not give an answer to the survey, 13f the population declares to be "spiritual but not religious" and 12o be atheist. [ 25 ] 
Politics [ edit ] 
Building of the Government of Tuva 
The head of the government in Tuva is the Chairman of the Government, who is elected for a four-year term. The first Chairman of the Government was Sherig-ool Oorzhak. As of 2007, the Chairman of the Government was Sholban Kara-ool. Tuva's legislature, the Great Khural, has 162seats; each deputy is elected to serve a four-year term.
The present flag of Tuvaa yellow for prosperity, blue for courage and strength, white for puritya was adopted on September17, 1992. See above under Religion .
The republic's Constitution was adopted on October23, 1993.
On April3, 2007, Russian president Vladimir Putin nominated Sholban Kara-ool, 40, a former champion wrestler, as the Chairman of the Government of Tuva. [ 33 ] Sholban's candidacy was approved by the Khural on April 9, 2007. [ 34 ] 
Economy [ edit ] 
A coal mine in Tuva 
Tuva has a developing mining industry (coal, cobalt, gold, and more). Food processing, timber, and metal working industries are also well-developed. Most of the industrial production is concentrated in the capital Kyzyl and in Ak-Dovurak. According to the HDI, the republic of Tuva is the least developed region in Russia.
Tourism [ edit ] 
Tuva is a region with a unique history, culture and nature. All native zones of the Earth except savanna (even rain forest, see Southern Siberian rainforest) are featured in Tuva. Tuva is well known by its spa-tourism. There are more than 100 mineral springs in Tuva. The biggest of them are warm mineral springs Ush-Beldir and Tarys, the temperature of water 52-85AC. Cold mineral springs and salty lakes are popular among tourists and population by their medicinal qualities. Geographical location of Tuva between east-siberian taiga and central-Asian landscape predetermined wealth of flora and fauna. More than 90f the territory is chase. Rare animals such as sable, lynx, wolverine, weasel, maral, Siberian ibex, and musk deer are only the part of Tuvan fauna.
Historical objects and ethnic culture are the top of interest: traditional habitat - yurta, national kitchen and handicraft, tuvan throat singing khomeii, national kinds of sport - wrestling competition Khuresh and horse riding. Annual festival "Ustuu-Khuree" and Naadym are the top of interest for tourists.
Transportation [ edit ] 
Tuva has as yet no railwaya although famous postage stamps in the 1930s, designed in Moscow during the time of Tuvan independence, mistakenly depict locomotives as demonstrating Soviet-inspired progress there. There is however a plan for construction of a railway line from the capital Kyzyl to Kuragino in Krasnoyarsk Krai. The railway will run for 410 kilometers (250mi). The main purpose for building the railway is to transport coal from coal mines in Kyzyl. [ 35 ] 
There are three roads leading to Tuva, a dirt track over the mountains from Khakassia to Ak Dovurak, and an asphalt road over the passes between Khakassia (Abakan) and Kyzyl: both of these are cut off by snowfall and avalanches from time to time in winter. The third road goes south, turning into a track before entering Mongolia. The only external bus and taxi services are between Khakassia (Abakan) and Kyzyl.
Kyzyl has both large public buses and private minibus services, and buses and taxis also connect Kyzyl with the larger settlements.
Passenger ferries ply the Greater Yenisei (Bii-Khem) between Kyzyl and Toora-Khem in Todzha (Upper Tuva) when there is neither too little nor too much water over the rapids.
There is a small airfield in Kyzyl with intermittent flights.
Culture [ edit ] 
Wrestling competition in Tos Bulak A yurt in Tos Bulak 
The Tuvan people are famous for Tuvan throat singing.
Khuresh, the Tuvan form of wrestling, is a very popular sport. Competitions are held at the annual Naadym festival at Tos-Bulak.
Sainkho Namtchylak is one of the few singers from Tuva to have an international following. She is also very involved with Tuvan culture. Every year she invites Western musicians to perform in Kyzyl and to learn about the country, its culture and its music. In recent years Kongar-ool Ondar has become well known in the West as well, in large part because of the film Genghis Blues featuring Ondar and American blues singer Paul Pena. Huun-Huur-Tu has been one of the most well known Tuvan music ensembles since the late 1990s, while the Alash ensemble came to prominence in the early 2000s.
The Tuvan language is Turkic, although with many loan-words from Mongolian. It is currently written with a modified Cyrillic alphabet, previously used Turkic runes, later Mongolian, then Latin alphabets. Then, Tuva was administered as part of Outer Mongolia, and the language difference was a determining factor in Tuva seeking full independence from Mongolia following the collapse of the Qing Dynasty.
Oral traditions [ edit ] 
The Tuvan people have a rich tradition of orally transmitted folklore, including many genres, ranging from very brief riddles and aphorisms, to tongue twisters, magical tales, hero tales, scary stories, and epics that would take many hours to recite. A few examples and excerpts of the epic genres, such as Boktu-Kirish, Bora-Sheelei have been published. This art form is now endangered as the traditional tale-tellers grow old and are not replaced by younger practitioners.
Sports [ edit ] 
Bandy is played in Tuva. [ 36 ] 
Education [ edit ] 
The most important facilities of higher education include the Tuvan State University and the Tuvan Institute of Humanities, both located in the capital Kyzyl.
Miscellaneous [ edit ] 
Tuva Stamp from 1927 In the 1920s and 1930s, postage stamps from Tuva were issued. Many philatelists, including the physicist Richard Feynman, have been fascinated with Tuva because of these stamps. The stamps were issued mainly during the brief period of Tuvan independence, and were not accepted by serious collectors until recently as they were thought to be produced in Moscow and not to represent a genuine postal service. [ 37 ] The stamps have been partly rehabilitated in philatelic circles recently. Feynman's efforts to reach Tuva are chronicled in the book Tuva or Bust! and the video The Quest For Tannu Tuva: Richard Feynman - The Last Journey of a Genius (1988) which can be viewed online on YouTube. Project Tuva was named in honor of his efforts., Tuva was featured prominently in the award-winning documentary Genghis Blues ., United Nations Human Development Index: Russian Federation - Republic of Tyva, rank: 79/79 (the lowest)., Tuvan stamps are mentioned in a line of Gregory Corso's poem Marriage., Tuvan Sergey Shoygu, Russia's Minister for Emergency Situations since 1994, is Russia's longest-serving minister, and a leader of Russia's governing party 'Unity'., Tuvans make wishes each morning, sprinkling milk on the ground, to the north, south, east and west, with a special wooden spoon with nine small hollows for the various milk products made., According to Ilya Zakharov of Moscow's Vavilov Institute of General Genetics, genetic evidence suggests that the modern Tuvan people are the closest genetic relatives to the native peoples of North and South America. [ 38 ] Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu , Some Tuvans, even near Kyzyl, still live in traditional yurts, round, demountable and portable dwellings with sectional lath trellis walls, decorated pole roofs and covered with white felt and canvas, with colourful cloth lining.
