Attempts to create a comprehensive legislative act which would regulate radioactive waste management in Russia have been made since 1992. In 1995, a draft federal law On the State Policy in the Sphere of Radioactive Waste Management was developed. however, the Federation Council rejected the specified bill. A Conciliation Committee was established. After certain amendments have been made to that bill, its name changed to "On Radioactive Waste Management". This wording was adopted by two chambers of Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and was submitted for signature to the President. However, Russian President dismissed the bill and sent it for revision. As a result, in 2001, the specified bill was excluded from further consideration by the State Duma. In 2008, Rosatom Federal Atomic Energy Agency promulgated the bill On Radioactive Waste Management.
