Constitution [ edit ] 
The Constitution of Kuwait was ratified in 1962 and has elements of a presidential and a parliamentary system of government. The Emir is the head of State and has the power to appoint the Prime Minister. Both the Emir and judicially independent Constitutional Court have the authority to dissolve the parliament.
The Kuwaiti parliament (per article 3 of the Constitution) has the constitutional right to approve and disapprove of an Emir's appointment, therefore the parliament has the authority to remove an Emir from his post. The parliament effectively removed Saad al-Sabah from his post in 2006 due to his illness.
The Constitution expressly supports political organizations, but they remain illegal as no law has arisen to define and regulate them. MPs tend to serve as Independents or as members of some loose affiliation or faction based on philosophy, sect, class or clan.
Citizens who have reached the age of 21 years, are not in the military and have not been convicted of a crime, can vote. Parliamentary candidates must be eligible to vote and at least 30 years old.
Elections [ edit ] 
National Assembly of Kuwait. 
The Parliament consists of fifty members who are elected in districts using the first past the post voting method. The major factions, de facto parties, are as follows;
National Democratic Alliance - Secular, neo-liberal faction. Has its own TV channel, Nabeeha Tahalof, and publishes the daily newspaper Al-Jarida., .

National Issues [ edit ] 
Two contentious issues, leading to six different elections between 1991a2008, involve issues pertaining to the electoral process and involvement of the ruling family in the government. The exclusion of women from the electoral process, prior to 2005, the minimum voting age of 21 and the fact that parties are still illegal, are also frequent points of contention.
2006 Election [ edit ] 
An early election was called in 2006 as disputes over the redistricting of legislative districts and dislike of the Prime Minister, led to the parliament being dissolved and new elections being called. The turnout rate was 66.4/p> 
A coalition of liberals and populist nationalists (Popular Action Bloc) won 18 seats, becoming the largest political bloc in the parliament. Sunni Islamists won 16 seats. Most of the 13 liberal Independent candidates who won, were expected to side with the ruling family and the remaining seats were won by a Shiite populist faction.
