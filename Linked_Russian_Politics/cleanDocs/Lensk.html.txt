History [ edit ] 
The original settlement was founded as Mukhtuya ( DNNNNN ) in 1663 by Russian fur traders, on the site of an older Evenk settlement known as Mukhtuy . [ citation needed ] The name of the original settlement was derived from an Evenk term meaning "great water".
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a place of political exile.
It experienced a period of rapid growth during the 20th century as a result of the discovery and development of diamond deposits in the Vilyuy River basin. As the closest significant settlement to the major kimberlite excavations at the Mir Mine and the establishment of the associated town of Mirny, Mukhtuya became a major base of construction. In 1956, roads were built connecting Mukhtuya to the future Mirny and the port was established. On July13, 1963, Mukhtuya was granted town status and was given its present name, after the river on which it stands. [ citation needed ] 
In May 2001, Lensk briefly came to the world's attention when almost the entire town was flooded and a large amount of the buildings destroyed. The floods were caused by river ice blocking the river downstream, creating a dam. The town was largely rebuilt after the flooding.
