 [EN Politics]  of  [EN Russia]  -  [EN Wikipedia] , the  [EN free]   [EN encyclopedia]  .
The  [EN politics]  of  [EN Russia]  ( [EN the_Russian_Federation] ) takes  [EN place]  in the framework of a federal  [EN semi-presidential_republic] .
According to the  [EN Constitution]  of  [EN Russia] , the  [EN President]  of  [EN Russia]  is  [EN head]  of  [EN state] , and of a  [EN multi-party_system]  with  [EN executive_power]  exercised by the  [EN government] , headed by the  [EN Prime_Minister] , who is appointed by the  [EN President]  with the  [EN parliament] 's approval.
 [EN Legislative_power]  is vested in the two  [EN houses]  of  [EN the_Federal_Assembly]  of  [EN the_Russian_Federation] , while the  [EN President]  and the  [EN government]   [EN issue]  numerous legally binding  [EN by-laws] .
Since gaining its  [EN independence]  with the collapse of  [EN the_Soviet_Union]  at the end of  [EN 1991] ,  [EN Russia]  has faced serious challenges in its  [EN efforts]  to forge a  [EN political_system]  to follow nearly seventy-five  [EN years]  of  [EN Soviet_rule] .
For instance, leading  [EN figures]  in the  [EN legislative]  and  [EN executive]   [EN branches]  have put forth opposing  [EN views]  of  [EN Russia] 's political  [EN direction]  and the governmental  [EN instruments]  that should be used to follow it.
That  [EN conflict]  reached a  [EN climax]  in September and  [EN October_1993] , when  [EN President_Boris_Yeltsin]  used military  [EN force]  to dissolve the  [EN parliament]  and called for  [EN new_legislative_elections]  ( see  [EN Russian_constitutional_crisis]  of  [EN 1993] ).
This  [EN event]  marked the end of  [EN Russia] 's first constitutional  [EN period] , which was defined by the much-amended  [EN constitution]  adopted by  [EN the_Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic]  in  [EN 1978] .
A  [EN new_constitution] , creating a strong  [EN presidency] , was approved by  [EN referendum]  in  [EN December_1993] .
With a  [EN new_constitution]  and a new  [EN parliament]  representing diverse  [EN parties]  and  [EN factions] ,  [EN Russia] 's political  [EN structure]  subsequently showed  [EN signs]  of stabilization.
As the  [EN transition]   [EN period]  extended into the  [EN mid-1990s] , the  [EN power]  of the  [EN national_government]  continued to wane as  [EN Russia] 's  [EN regions]  gained political and economic  [EN concessions]  from  [EN Moscow] .
Although the struggle between  [EN executive]  and  [EN legislative]   [EN branches]  was partially resolved by the  [EN new_constitution] , the two  [EN branches]  continued to represent fundamentally opposing  [EN visions]  of  [EN Russia] 's  [EN future] .
Most of the time, the  [EN executive]  was the  [EN center]  of  [EN reform] , and the  [EN lower_house]  of the  [EN parliament] ,  [EN State_Duma] , was a  [EN bastion]  of  [EN anti-reform]   [EN communists]  and  [EN nationalists.]   [EN citation]  needed .

Historical  [EN background]  edit .
This  [EN section]  is too long.

(March  [EN 2012] ) ,  [EN The_Soviet_Union]  came into being under the  [EN treaty]  of  [EN union]  in December  [EN 1922] , which was signed by  [EN Russia]  and three other  [EN union_republics]  a  [EN Belarus] ,  [EN Ukraine] , and what was then the  [EN Transcaucasian_Soviet_Federated_Socialist_Republic]  (an  [EN entity]  including what is now  [EN Armenia] ,  [EN Azerbaijan] , and  [EN Georgia] ).
Under the  [EN treaty] ,  [EN Russia]  became known as the  [EN Russian_Soviet_Federated_Socialist_Republic]  ( [EN RSFSR] ).
The  [EN treaty]  of  [EN union]  was incorporated into the  [EN first]   [EN Soviet_constitution] , which was promulgated in  [EN 1924] .
Nominally, the  [EN borders]  of each  [EN subunit]  were drawn to incorporate the  [EN territory]  of a specific  [EN nationality] .
The  [EN constitution]  endowed the new  [EN republics]  with  [EN sovereignty] , although they were said to have voluntarily delegated most of their  [EN sovereign]   [EN powers]  to the  [EN Soviet]   [EN center] .
Formal  [EN sovereignty]  was evidenced by the existence of  [EN flags] ,  [EN constitutions] , and other  [EN state_symbols] , and by the  [EN republics] ' constitutionally guaranteed " [EN right] " to secede from the  [EN union] .
 [EN Russia]  was the largest of the  [EN Union_republics]  in  [EN terms]  of  [EN territory]  and  [EN population] .
During  [EN the_Cold_War]  era, ethnic Russians dominated Soviet politics and government; they also controlled local administration [EN Cold_War_era] [EN ethnic_Russians] [EN Soviet] [EN politics] [EN government] [EN administration] 
Because of the  [EN Russians] ' dominance in the  [EN affairs]  of the  [EN union] , the  [EN RSFSR]  failed to develop some of the  [EN institutions]  of  [EN governance]  and  [EN administration]  that were typical of public  [EN life]  in the other  [EN republics] : a  [EN republic-level]   [EN communist_party] , a  [EN Russian]   [EN academy]  of  [EN sciences] , and  [EN Russian]   [EN branches]  of  [EN trade_unions] , for  [EN example] .
As the titular nationalities of the other fourteen  [EN union_republics]  began to call for greater  [EN republic]   [EN rights]  in the late  [EN 1980s] , however,  [EN ethnic_Russians]  also began to demand the creation or strengthening of various specifically  [EN Russian]   [EN institutions]  in the  [EN RSFSR] .
Certain  [EN policies]  of  [EN Soviet]  leader  [EN Mikhail_Gorbachev]  (in  [EN office]  1985-91) also encouraged nationalities in the  [EN union_republics] , including the  [EN Russian_Republic] , to assert their  [EN rights] .
These  [EN policies]  included  [EN glasnost]  (literally, public  [EN voicing] ), which made possible  [EN open]  discussion of  [EN democratic]   [EN reforms]  and long-ignored public  [EN problems]  such as  [EN pollution] .
 [EN Glasnost]  also brought constitutional  [EN reforms]  that led to the  [EN election]  of new  [EN republic]   [EN legislatures]  with substantial blocs of  [EN pro-reform]   [EN representatives] .
In  [EN Russia]  a new  [EN legislature] , called the  [EN Congress]  of  [EN People's_Deputies] , was elected in  [EN March_1990]  in a largely  [EN free]  and competitive vote.
Upon convening in May, the  [EN congress]  elected  [EN Boris_Yeltsin] , a onetime  [EN Gorbachev]  protAgA who had been exiled from the top  [EN party]  echelon because of his  [EN radical]   [EN reform]  proposals and erratic  [EN personality] , as  [EN president]  of the  [EN congress] 's permanent  [EN working_body] ,  [EN the_Supreme_Soviet] .
The next  [EN month] , the  [EN Congress]  declared  [EN Russia] 's  [EN sovereignty]  over its  [EN natural_resources]  and the primacy of  [EN Russia] 's  [EN laws]  over those of the central  [EN Soviet_government] .
During  [EN 1990-91] , the  [EN RSFSR]  enhanced its  [EN sovereignty]  by establishing  [EN republic]   [EN branches]  of  [EN organizations]  such as  [EN the_Communist_Party] ,  [EN the_Academy_of_Sciences]  of  [EN the_Soviet_Union] ,  [EN radio]  and  [EN television]  broadcasting  [EN facilities] , and  [EN the_Committee_for_State_Security]  (Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnostiaKGB).
In  [EN 1991]   [EN Russia]  created a new  [EN executive_office] , the  [EN presidency] , following the  [EN example]  of  [EN Gorbachev] , who had created such an  [EN office]  for himself in  [EN 1990] .
The  [EN following_election]  of  [EN June_1991]  conferred legitimacy on the  [EN office] , whereas  [EN Gorbachev]  had eschewed such an  [EN election]  and had had himself appointed by the  [EN Soviet_parliament] .
Despite  [EN Gorbachev] 's  [EN attempts]  to discourage  [EN Russia] 's  [EN electorate]  from voting for him,  [EN Yeltsin]  was popularly elected as  [EN president] , handily defeating five other  [EN candidates]  with more than 57 percent of the vote.
 [EN Yeltsin]  used his  [EN role]  as  [EN president]  to  [EN trumpet]   [EN Russian]   [EN sovereignty]  and  [EN patriotism] , and his legitimacy as  [EN president]  was a major  [EN cause]  of the collapse of the  [EN coup]  by  [EN hard-line]   [EN government]  and  [EN party]   [EN officials]  against  [EN Gorbachev]  in  [EN August_1991]   [EN Soviet]   [EN Coup]  of  [EN 1991] .
( see  [EN August_coup]  of  [EN 1991] ) The  [EN coup]   [EN leaders]  had attempted to overthrow  [EN Gorbachev]  in  [EN order]  to halt his  [EN plan]  to sign a  [EN New_Union_Treaty]  that they believed would wreck  [EN the_Soviet_Union] .
 [EN Yeltsin]  defiantly opposed the  [EN coup]  plotters and called for  [EN Gorbachev] 's  [EN restoration] , rallying the  [EN Russian]  public.
Most important,  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN faction]  led  [EN elements]  in the " [EN power]   [EN ministries] " that controlled the military, the  [EN police] , and the  [EN KGB]  to refuse to obey the  [EN orders]  of the  [EN coup]  plotters.
The opposition led by  [EN Yeltsin] , combined with the irresolution of the plotters, caused the  [EN coup]  to collapse after three  [EN days] .
Following the failed  [EN coup] ,  [EN Gorbachev]  found a fundamentally changed  [EN constellation]  of  [EN power] , with  [EN Yeltsin]  in  [EN de_facto]   [EN control]  of much of a sometimes recalcitrant  [EN Soviet]  administrative apparatus.
Although  [EN Gorbachev]  returned to his  [EN position]  as  [EN Soviet]   [EN president] ,  [EN events]  began to bypass him.
 [EN Communist_party]   [EN activities]  were suspended.
Most of the  [EN union_republics]  quickly declared their  [EN independence] , although many appeared willing to sign  [EN Gorbachev] 's vaguely delineated  [EN confederation]   [EN treaty] .
The  [EN Baltic_states]  achieved full  [EN independence] , and they quickly received  [EN diplomatic_recognition]  from many  [EN nations] .
 [EN Gorbachev] 's rump  [EN government]  recognized the  [EN independence]  of  [EN Estonia] ,  [EN Latvia] , and  [EN Lithuania]  in August and  [EN September_1991] .
In late  [EN 1991] , the  [EN Yeltsin]   [EN government]  assumed budgetary  [EN control]  over  [EN Gorbachev] 's rump  [EN government] .
 [EN Russia]  did not declare its  [EN independence] , and  [EN Yeltsin]  continued to hope that some  [EN form]  of  [EN confederation]  could be established.
In December, one  [EN week]  after the  [EN Ukrainian_Republic]  approved  [EN independence]  by  [EN referendum] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  and the  [EN leaders]  of  [EN Ukraine]  and  [EN Belarus]  met to form the  [EN Commonwealth_of_Independent_States]  ( [EN CIS] ).
In  [EN response]  to calls by the  [EN Central_Asian]  and other  [EN union_republics]  for  [EN admission] , another  [EN meeting]  was held in  [EN Alma-Ata] , on  [EN 21_December] , to form an expanded  [EN CIS] .
At that  [EN meeting] , all  [EN parties]  declared that the  [EN 1922]   [EN treaty]  of  [EN union]  creating  [EN the_Soviet_Union]  was annulled and that  [EN the_Soviet_Union]  had ceased to exist.
 [EN Gorbachev]  announced the  [EN decision]  officially on  [EN 25_December] .
 [EN Russia]  gained  [EN international]  recognition as the  [EN principal]  successor to  [EN the_Soviet_Union] , receiving  [EN the_Soviet_Union's]  permanent seat on  [EN the_United_Nations_Security_Council]  and  [EN positions]  in other  [EN international]  and regional  [EN organizations] .
The  [EN CIS]   [EN states]  also agreed that  [EN Russia]  initially would take over  [EN Soviet]   [EN embassies]  and other  [EN properties]  abroad.
In  [EN October_1991] , during the " [EN honeymoon] "  [EN period]  after his resistance to the  [EN Soviet]   [EN coup] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  convinced the  [EN legislature]  to grant him  [EN special]   [EN executive]  (and legislative)  [EN powers]  for one year so that he might implement his  [EN economic_reforms] .
In  [EN November]   [EN 1991] , he appointed a new  [EN government] , with himself as acting  [EN prime_minister] , a  [EN post]  he held until the  [EN appointment]  of  [EN Yegor_Gaidar]  as acting  [EN prime_minister]  in  [EN June_1992] .
During  [EN 1992]   [EN Yeltsin]  and his  [EN reforms]  came under increasing  [EN attack]  by former  [EN Communist_Party]  of  [EN the_Soviet_Union]   [EN members]  and  [EN officials] , extreme  [EN nationalists] , and  [EN others]  calling for  [EN reform]  to be slowed or even halted in  [EN Russia] .
A  [EN locus]  of this opposition was increasingly the two-level  [EN parliament] , whose upper level was the  [EN Congress]  of  [EN People's_Deputies]  ( [EN CPD] ) and lower level  [EN the_Supreme_Soviet] .
The lower level was headed by  [EN Ruslan_Khasbulatov] , who became  [EN Yeltsin] 's most vocal  [EN opponent] .
Under the  [EN 1978_constitution] , the  [EN parliament]  was the supreme  [EN organ]  of  [EN power]  in  [EN Russia] .
After  [EN Russia]  added the  [EN office]  of  [EN president]  in  [EN 1991] , the  [EN division]  of  [EN powers]  between the two  [EN branches]  was ambiguous, while the  [EN Congress]  of  [EN People's_Deputies]  has retained its obvious  [EN power]  "to examine and resolve any  [EN matter]  within the  [EN jurisdiction]  of  [EN the_Russian_Federation"] .
In  [EN 1992]  the  [EN Congress]  was even further empowered, including  [EN ability]  to suspend any  [EN articles]  of the  [EN Constitution]  (per amended art.
 [EN 185]  of the  [EN 1978_Constitution]  ( [EN Basic_Law] ) of  [EN the_Russian_Federation] ).
Although  [EN Yeltsin]  managed to beat back most challenges to his  [EN reform]   [EN program]  when the  [EN CPD]  met in  [EN April_1992] , in December he suffered a significant loss of his  [EN special]   [EN executive]   [EN powers] .
The  [EN CPD]  ordered him to halt  [EN appointments]  of  [EN administrators]  in the  [EN localities]  and also the  [EN practice]  of naming additional local oversight emissaries (termed "presidential  [EN representatives] ").
 [EN Yeltsin]  also lost the  [EN power]  to issue  [EN special]  decrees concerning the  [EN economy] , while retaining his constitutional  [EN power]  to issue decrees in accordance with existing  [EN laws] .
When his  [EN attempt]  to secure  [EN confirmation]  of  [EN Gaidar]  as  [EN prime_minister]  was rejected,  [EN Yeltsin]  appointed  [EN Viktor_Chernomyrdin] , whom the  [EN parliament]  approved because he was viewed as more  [EN economically_conservative]  than  [EN Gaidar] .
After contentious negotiations between the  [EN parliament]  and  [EN Yeltsin] , the two sides agreed to hold a  [EN national_referendum]  to allow the  [EN population]  to determine the basic  [EN division]  of  [EN powers]  between the two  [EN branches]  of  [EN government] .
In the meantime, proposals for extreme limitation of  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN power]  were tabled.
However, early  [EN 1993]  saw increasing tension between  [EN Yeltsin]  and the  [EN parliament]  over the  [EN referendum]  and  [EN power]  sharing.
In mid-March  [EN 1993] , an  [EN emergency]  session of the  [EN CPD]  rejected  [EN Yeltsin] 's proposals on  [EN power]  sharing and canceled the  [EN referendum] , again opening the  [EN door]  to  [EN legislation]  that would shift the  [EN balance]  of  [EN power]  away from the  [EN president] .
Faced with these setbacks,  [EN Yeltsin]  addressed the  [EN nation]  directly to announce a " [EN special]  regime", under which he would assume extraordinary  [EN executive_power]  pending the  [EN results]  of a  [EN referendum]  on the timing of  [EN new_legislative_elections] , on a  [EN new_constitution] , and on public confidence in the  [EN president]  and  [EN vice_president] .
After  [EN the_Constitutional_Court]  declared his  [EN announcement]  unconstitutional,  [EN Yeltsin]  backed down.
Despite  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN change]  of heart, a  [EN second]  extraordinary session of the  [EN CPD]  took up discussion of  [EN emergency]   [EN measures]  to defend the  [EN constitution] , including  [EN impeachment]  of the  [EN president] .
Although the  [EN impeachment]  vote failed, the  [EN CPD]  set new  [EN terms]  for a  [EN popular_referendum] .
The  [EN legislature] 's  [EN version]  of the  [EN referendum]  asked whether  [EN citizens]  had confidence in  [EN Yeltsin] , approved of his  [EN reforms] , and supported early  [EN presidential_and_legislative_elections] .
Under the  [EN CPD] 's  [EN terms] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  would need the support of 50 percent of eligible voters, rather than 50 percent of those actually voting, to avoid an early  [EN presidential_election] .
In the vote on  [EN 25_April] ,  [EN Russians]  failed to provide this level of approval, but a majority of voters approved  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN policies]  and called for  [EN new_legislative_elections] .
 [EN Yeltsin]  termed the  [EN results] , which were a serious blow to the prestige of the  [EN parliament] , a  [EN mandate]  for him to continue in  [EN power] .
In  [EN June_1993] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  decreed the creation of a  [EN special]   [EN constitutional_convention]  to examine the  [EN draft]   [EN constitution]  that he had presented in April.
This  [EN convention]  was designed to circumvent the  [EN parliament] , which was working on its own  [EN draft]   [EN constitution] .
As expected, the two  [EN main]  drafts contained contrary  [EN views]  of  [EN legislative-executive]   [EN relations] .
The  [EN convention] , which included  [EN delegates]  from major political and social  [EN organizations]  and the 89  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions] , approved a compromise  [EN draft]   [EN constitution]  in July  [EN 1993] , incorporating some  [EN aspects]  of the  [EN parliament] 's  [EN draft] .
The  [EN parliament]  failed to approve the  [EN draft] , however.
On  [EN 3_October] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  chose a  [EN radical]   [EN solution]  to settle his  [EN dispute]  with  [EN parliament] : he called up  [EN tanks]  to shell the  [EN parliament]   [EN building] , blasting out his  [EN opponents] .
As  [EN Yeltsin]  was taking the  [EN unconstitutional]  step of dissolving the  [EN legislature] ,  [EN Russia]  came the closest to serious  [EN civil_conflict]  since the  [EN revolution]  of  [EN 1917] .
In late  [EN September_1993] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  responded to the  [EN impasse]  in  [EN legislative-executive]   [EN relations]  by repeating his  [EN announcement]  of a  [EN constitutional_referendum] , but this time he followed the  [EN announcement]  by dissolving the  [EN parliament]  and announcing  [EN new_legislative_elections]  for December.
( see  [EN Russian_constitutional_crisis]  of  [EN 1993] ) The  [EN CPD]  again met in  [EN emergency]  session, confirmed  [EN Vice_President]   [EN Aleksandr_Rutskoy]  as  [EN president] , and voted to impeach  [EN Yeltsin] .
On  [EN 27_September] , military  [EN units]  surrounded the  [EN legislative_building]  (popularly known as  [EN the_White_House] ), but 180  [EN delegates]  refused to leave the  [EN building] .
After a  [EN two-week]  standoff,  [EN Rutskoy]  urged  [EN supporters]  outside the  [EN legislative_building]  to overcome  [EN Yeltsin] 's military  [EN forces] .
Firefights and destruction of  [EN property]  resulted at several  [EN locations]  in  [EN Moscow] .
The next day, under the  [EN direction]  of  [EN Minister]  of  [EN Defense]   [EN Pavel_Grachev] ,  [EN tanks]  fired on  [EN the_White_House] , and military  [EN forces]  occupied the  [EN building]  and the rest of the  [EN city] .
This  [EN open] , violent  [EN confrontation]  remained a backdrop to  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN relations]  with the  [EN legislative_branch]  for the next three  [EN years] .
 [EN Constitution]  and  [EN government]   [EN structure]  edit .
Presidential copy of the  [EN Russian_Constitution]  .
During  [EN 1992-93_Yeltsin]  had argued that the existing, heavily amended  [EN 1978_constitution]  of  [EN Russia]  was obsolete and  [EN self-contradictory]  and that  [EN Russia]  required a  [EN new_constitution]  granting the  [EN president]  greater  [EN power] .
This assertion led to the  [EN submission]  and advocacy of rival constitutional drafts drawn up by the  [EN legislative]  and  [EN executive]   [EN branches] .
The  [EN parliament] 's  [EN failure]  to endorse a compromise was an important  [EN factor]  in  [EN Yeltsin] 's dissolution of that  [EN body]  in  [EN September_1993] .
 [EN Yeltsin]  then used his presidential  [EN powers]  to form a sympathetic  [EN constitutional_assembly] , which quickly produced a  [EN draft]   [EN constitution]  providing for a strong  [EN executive] , and to shape the outcome of the December  [EN 1993_referendum]  on  [EN Russia] 's new  [EN basic_law] .
The  [EN turnout]   [EN requirement]  for the  [EN referendum]  was changed from 50 percent of the  [EN electorate]  to simply 50 percent of participating voters.
The  [EN referendum]  vote resulted in approval by 58.4 percent of  [EN Russia] 's registered voters.
The  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution]  declares  [EN Russia]  a  [EN democratic] ,  [EN federative] , law-based  [EN state]  with a  [EN republican]   [EN form]  of  [EN government] .
 [EN State]   [EN power]  is divided among the  [EN legislative] ,  [EN executive] , and judicial  [EN branches] .
Diversity of  [EN ideologies]  and  [EN religions]  is sanctioned, and a  [EN state]  or compulsory  [EN ideology]  may not be adopted.
The  [EN right]  to a  [EN multiparty]   [EN political_system]  is upheld.
The content of  [EN laws]  must be made public before they take effect, and they must be formulated in accordance with  [EN international_law]  and  [EN principles] .
 [EN Russian]  is proclaimed the  [EN state_language] , although the  [EN republics]  of the  [EN federation]  are allowed to establish their own  [EN state] .
 [EN Executive]   [EN branch]  edit .
 [EN Main]   [EN office]   [EN holders]   [EN Office_Name_Party_Since]   [EN President] ,  [EN Vladimir_Putin] ,  [EN United_Russia] ,  [EN 7_May]   [EN 2012] ,  [EN Prime_Minister] ,  [EN Dmitry_Medvedev] ,  [EN United_Russia] ,  [EN 8_May]   [EN 2012] , The  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution]  created a dual  [EN executive]  consisting of a  [EN president]  and  [EN prime_minister] , but the  [EN president]  is the dominant  [EN figure] .
 [EN Russia] 's strong  [EN presidency]  sometimes is compared with that of  [EN Charles_de_Gaulle]  (in  [EN office]  1958-69) in the  [EN French_Fifth_Republic] .
The  [EN constitution]  spells out many prerogatives specifically, but some  [EN powers]  enjoyed by  [EN Yeltsin]  were developed in an  [EN ad_hoc]  manner.
Presidential  [EN powers]  edit .
 [EN Russia] 's  [EN president]  determines the basic  [EN direction]  of  [EN Russia] 's domestic and  [EN foreign_policy]  and represents the  [EN Russian_state]  within the  [EN country]  and in  [EN foreign_affairs] .
The  [EN president]  appoints and recalls  [EN Russia] 's  [EN ambassadors]  upon consultation with the  [EN legislature] , accepts the credentials and  [EN letters]  of recall of foreign  [EN representatives] , conducts  [EN international]  talks, and  [EN signs]   [EN international_treaties] .
A  [EN special]  provision allowed  [EN Yeltsin]  to complete the term prescribed to end in  [EN June_1996]  and to exercise the  [EN powers]  of the  [EN new_constitution] , although he had been elected under a different constitutional  [EN order] .
In the 1996  [EN presidential_election_campaign] , some  [EN candidates]  called for eliminating the  [EN presidency] , criticizing its  [EN powers]  as dictatorial.
 [EN Yeltsin]  defended his presidential  [EN powers] , claiming that  [EN Russians]  desire "a vertical  [EN power_structure]  and a strong hand" and that a  [EN parliamentary_government]  would result in indecisive talk rather than  [EN action] .
Several prescribed  [EN powers]  put the  [EN president]  in a superior  [EN position]  vis-A-vis the  [EN legislature] .
The  [EN president]  has broad authority to issue decrees and  [EN directives]  that have the  [EN force]  of  [EN law]  without  [EN legislative]   [EN review] , although the  [EN constitution]  notes that they must not contravene that  [EN document]  or other  [EN laws] .
Under certain  [EN conditions] , the  [EN president]  may dissolve  [EN the_State_Duma] , the  [EN lower_house]  of  [EN parliament] ,  [EN the_Federal_Assembly] .
The  [EN president]  has the prerogatives of scheduling  [EN referendums]  (a  [EN power]  previously reserved to the  [EN parliament] ), submitting  [EN draft]   [EN laws]  to  [EN the_State_Duma] , and promulgating federal  [EN laws] .
The  [EN executive-legislative]   [EN crisis]  of the fall of  [EN 1993]  prompted  [EN Yeltsin]  to emplace constitutional  [EN obstacles]  to  [EN legislative]  removal of the  [EN president] .
Under the  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution] , if the  [EN president]  commits "grave  [EN crimes] " or  [EN treason] ,  [EN the_State_Duma]  may file  [EN impeachment]   [EN charges]  with the  [EN parliament] 's  [EN upper_house] ,  [EN the_Federation_Council] .
These  [EN charges]  must be confirmed by a ruling of  [EN the_Supreme_Court]  that the  [EN president] 's  [EN actions]  constitute a  [EN crime]  and by a ruling of  [EN the_Constitutional_Court]  that proper  [EN procedures]  in filing  [EN charges]  have been followed.
The  [EN charges]  then must be adopted by a  [EN special]   [EN commission]  of  [EN the_State_Duma]  and confirmed by at least two-thirds of  [EN State_Duma]   [EN deputies] .
A  [EN two-thirds_vote]  of  [EN the_Federation_Council]  is required for removal of the  [EN president] .
If  [EN the_Federation_Council]  does not act within three  [EN months] , the  [EN charges]  are dropped.
If the  [EN president]  is removed from  [EN office]  or becomes unable to exercise  [EN power]  because of serious  [EN illness] , the  [EN prime_minister]  is to temporarily assume the  [EN president] 's  [EN duties] ; a  [EN presidential_election]  then must be held within three  [EN months] .
The  [EN constitution]  does not provide for a  [EN vice_president] , and there is no specific  [EN procedure]  for determining whether the  [EN president]  is able to carry out his  [EN duties] .
The  [EN president]  is empowered to appoint the  [EN prime_minister]  to  [EN chair]  the  [EN Government]  (called the  [EN cabinet]  or the  [EN council]  of  [EN ministers]  in other  [EN countries] ), with the consent of  [EN the_State_Duma] .
The  [EN president]   [EN chairs]   [EN meetings]  of the  [EN Government] , which he also may dismiss in its entirety.
Upon the advice of the  [EN prime_minister] , the  [EN president]  can appoint or remove  [EN Government]   [EN members] , including the  [EN deputy_prime_ministers] .
The  [EN president]  submits  [EN candidates]  to  [EN the_State_Duma]  for the  [EN post]  of  [EN chairman]  of  [EN the_Central_Bank]  of  [EN the_Russian_Federation]  ( [EN RCB] ) and may propose that  [EN the_State_Duma]  dismiss the  [EN chairman] .
In addition, the  [EN president]  submits  [EN candidates]  to  [EN the_Federation_Council]  for  [EN appointment]  as  [EN justices]  of  [EN the_Constitutional_Court] ,  [EN the_Supreme_Court] , and  [EN the_Superior_Court_of_Arbitration] , as well as  [EN candidates]  for the  [EN office]  of  [EN procurator]   [EN general] ,  [EN Russia] 's  [EN chief]   [EN law_enforcement_officer] .
The  [EN president]  also appoints  [EN justices]  of  [EN federal_district_courts] .
Informal  [EN powers]  and  [EN power_centers]  edit .
Many of the  [EN president] 's  [EN powers]  are related to the  [EN incumbent] 's undisputed leeway in forming an  [EN administration]  and hiring staff.
The  [EN presidential_administration]  is composed of several competing, overlapping, and vaguely delineated  [EN hierarchies]  that historically have resisted  [EN efforts]  at consolidation.
In early  [EN 1996] ,  [EN Russian]   [EN sources]  reported the size of the presidential apparatus in  [EN Moscow]  and the  [EN localities]  at more than 75, 000 people, most of them employees of  [EN state-owned_enterprises]  directly under presidential  [EN control] .
This  [EN structure]  is similar to, but several  [EN times]  larger than, the top-level apparatus of the  [EN Soviet-era]   [EN Communist_Party]  of  [EN the_Soviet_Union]  ( [EN CPSU] ).
Former first  [EN deputy]   [EN prime_minister]   [EN Anatoly_Chubais]  was appointed  [EN chief]  of the  [EN presidential_administration]  ( [EN chief]  of staff) in  [EN July_1996] .
 [EN Chubais]  replaced  [EN Nikolay_Yegorov] , a  [EN hard-line]   [EN associate]  of deposed  [EN Presidential_Security_Service]   [EN chief]   [EN Alexander_Korzhakov] .
 [EN Yegorov]  had been appointed in early  [EN 1996] , when  [EN Yeltsin]  reacted to the strong showing of antireform  [EN factions]  in the  [EN legislative_election]  by purging  [EN reformers]  from his  [EN administration] .
 [EN Yeltsin]  now ordered  [EN Chubais] , who had been included in that  [EN purge] , to reduce the size of the  [EN administration]  and the number of  [EN departments]  overseeing the  [EN functions]  of the ministerial apparatus.
The six administrative  [EN departments]  in existence at that time dealt with  [EN citizens] '  [EN rights] , domestic and  [EN foreign_policy] ,  [EN state]  and legal  [EN matters] ,  [EN personnel] , analysis, and oversight, and  [EN Chubais]  inherited a staff estimated at 2, 000  [EN employees] .
 [EN Chubais]  also received  [EN control]  over a presidential  [EN advisory]   [EN group]  with input on the  [EN economy] ,  [EN national_security] , and other  [EN matters] .
Reportedly that  [EN group]  had competed with  [EN Korzhakov] 's  [EN security_service]  for influence in the  [EN Yeltsin]   [EN administration] .
Another  [EN center]  of  [EN power]  in the  [EN presidential_administration]  is  [EN the_Security_Council] , which was created by  [EN statute]  in mid-1992.
The  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution]  describes the  [EN council]  as formed and headed by the  [EN president]  and governed by  [EN statute] .
Since its  [EN formation] , it apparently has gradually lost influence in  [EN competition]  with other  [EN power_centers]  in the  [EN presidential_administration] .
However, the  [EN June_1996]   [EN appointment]  of former  [EN army_general]  and presidential  [EN candidate]   [EN Alexander_Lebed]  to head the  [EN Security_Council]  improved  [EN prospects]  for the  [EN organization] 's standing.
In  [EN July_1996] , a  [EN presidential_decree]  assigned  [EN the_Security_Council]  a wide  [EN variety]  of new  [EN missions] .
The  [EN decree] 's  [EN description]  of  [EN the_Security_Council's]  consultative  [EN functions]  was especially vague and wide-ranging, although it positioned the  [EN head]  of  [EN the_Security_Council]  directly subordinate to the  [EN president] .
As had been the  [EN case]  previously,  [EN the_Security_Council]  was required to hold  [EN meetings]  at least once a  [EN month] .
Other presidential support  [EN services]  include  [EN the_Control_Directorate]  (in  [EN charge]  of investigating  [EN official_corruption] ),  [EN the_Administrative_Affairs_Directorate] ,  [EN the_Presidential_Press_Service] , and  [EN the_Protocol_Directorate] .
 [EN The_Administrative_Affairs_Directorate]  controls  [EN state]   [EN dachas] , sanatoriums,  [EN automobiles] ,  [EN office]   [EN buildings] , and other  [EN perquisites]  of high  [EN office]  for the  [EN executive] , legislative, and judicial  [EN branches]  of  [EN government] , a  [EN function]  that includes management of more than 200  [EN state_industries]  with about 50, 000  [EN employees] .
 [EN The_Committee_on_Operational_Questions] , until  [EN June_1996]  chaired by antireformist  [EN Oleg_Soskovets] , has been described as a " [EN government]  within a  [EN government] ".
Also attached to the  [EN presidency]  are more than two dozen consultative  [EN commissions]  and extrabudgetary " [EN funds] ". The  [EN president]  also has extensive  [EN powers]  over military  [EN policy] .
As the  [EN Supreme_Commander-in-Chief]  of  [EN the_Armed_Forces]  of  [EN the_Russian_Federation]  of the  [EN armed_forces] , the  [EN president]  approves  [EN defense]   [EN doctrine] , appoints and removes the high  [EN command]  of the  [EN armed_forces] , and confers higher  [EN military_ranks]  and  [EN awards] .
The  [EN president]  is empowered to declare  [EN national]  or regional  [EN states]  of  [EN martial_law] , as well as  [EN state]  of  [EN emergency] .
In both  [EN cases] , both  [EN houses]  of the  [EN parliament]  must be notified immediately.
 [EN The_Federation_Council] , the  [EN upper_house] , has the  [EN power]  to confirm or reject such a  [EN decree] .
The regime of  [EN martial_law]  is defined by  [EN federal_law]  "On  [EN Martial_law] ", signed into  [EN law]  by  [EN president]   [EN Vladimir_Putin]  in  [EN 2002] .
The circumstances and  [EN procedures]  for the  [EN president]  to declare a  [EN state]  of  [EN emergency]  are more specifically outlined in  [EN federal_law]  than in the  [EN constitution] .
In  [EN practice] ,  [EN the_Constitutional_Court]  ruled in  [EN 1995]  that the  [EN president]  has wide leeway in responding to  [EN crises]  within  [EN Russia] , such as lawlessness in the  [EN separatist]   [EN Republic_of_Chechnya] , and that  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN action]  in  [EN Chechnya]  did not require a formal  [EN declaration]  of a  [EN state]  of  [EN emergency] .
In  [EN 1994]   [EN Yeltsin]  declared a  [EN state]  of  [EN emergency]  in  [EN Ingushetia]  and  [EN North_Ossetia] , two  [EN republics]  beset by intermittent  [EN ethnic_conflict] .
 [EN Presidential_elections]  edit .
The  [EN constitution]  sets few  [EN requirements]  for  [EN presidential_elections] , deferring in many  [EN matters]  to other provisions established by  [EN law] .
The presidential term is set at six  [EN years] , and the  [EN president]  may only serve two consecutive  [EN terms] .
A  [EN candidate]  for  [EN president]  must be a  [EN citizen]  of  [EN Russia] , at least 35  [EN years]  of  [EN age] , and a  [EN resident]  of the  [EN country]  for at least ten  [EN years] .
If a  [EN president]  becomes unable to continue in  [EN office]  because of health  [EN problems] , resignation,  [EN impeachment] , or death, a  [EN presidential_election]  is to be held not more than three  [EN months]  later.
In such a situation,  [EN the_Federation_Council]  is empowered to set the  [EN election]   [EN date] .
The  [EN Law]  on  [EN Presidential_Elections] , ratified in  [EN May_1995] , establishes the legal basis for  [EN presidential_elections] .
Based on a  [EN draft]  submitted by  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN office] , the new  [EN law]  included many provisions already contained in the  [EN Russian_Republic] 's  [EN 1990_election]   [EN law] ; alterations included the reduction in the number of  [EN signatures]  required to register a  [EN candidate]  from 2million to 1million.
The  [EN law] , which set rigorous  [EN standards]  for  [EN fair]   [EN campaign]  and  [EN election_procedures] , was hailed by  [EN international]   [EN analysts]  as a major step toward  [EN democratization] .
Under the  [EN law] ,  [EN parties] , blocs, and voters'  [EN groups]  register with the  [EN Central_Electoral_Commission_of_Russia]  ( [EN CEC] ) and designate their  [EN candidates] .
These  [EN organizations]  then are permitted to begin seeking the 1million  [EN signatures]  needed to register their  [EN candidates] ; no more than 7 percent of the  [EN signatures]  may come from a single  [EN federal_jurisdiction] .
The purpose of the 7 percent  [EN requirement]  is to promote candidacies with broad territorial  [EN bases]  and eliminate those supported by only one  [EN city]  or  [EN ethnic_enclave] .
The  [EN law]  requires that at least 50 percent of eligible voters participate in  [EN order]  for a  [EN presidential_election]  to be valid.
In  [EN State_Duma]   [EN debate]  over the  [EN legislation] , some  [EN deputies]  had advocated a minimum of 25 percent (which was later incorporated into the  [EN electoral_law]  covering  [EN the_State_Duma] ), warning that many  [EN Russians]  were disillusioned with voting and would not turn out.
To make voter participation more appealing, the  [EN law]  required one  [EN voting_precinct]  for approximately every 3, 000 voters, with voting allowed until late at night.
The  [EN conditions]  for  [EN absentee_voting]  were eased, and portable ballot  [EN boxes]  were to be made available on demand.
Strict  [EN requirements]  were established for the presence of  [EN election_observers] , including emissaries from all participating  [EN parties] , blocs, and  [EN groups] , at  [EN polling_places]  and local electoral  [EN commissions]  to guard against tampering and to ensure proper tabulation.
The  [EN Law]  on  [EN Presidential_Elections]  requires that the  [EN winner]  receive more than 50 percent of the votes cast.
If no  [EN candidate]  receives more than 50 percent of the vote (a highly probable  [EN result]  because of  [EN multiple]  candidacies), the top two vote-getters must face each other in a  [EN runoff_election] .
Once the  [EN results]  of the first  [EN round]  are known, the  [EN runoff_election]  must be held within fifteen  [EN days] .
A traditional provision allows voters to check off "none of the above, " meaning that a  [EN candidate]  in a  [EN two-person]   [EN runoff]  might win without attaining a majority.
Another provision of the  [EN election_law]  empowers the  [EN CEC]  to request that  [EN the_Supreme_Court]  ban a  [EN candidate]  from the  [EN election]  if that  [EN candidate]  advocates a violent transformation of the constitutional  [EN order]  or the integrity of  [EN the_Russian_Federation] .
The  [EN presidential_election]  of  [EN 1996]  was a major  [EN episode]  in the struggle between  [EN Yeltsin]  and the  [EN Communist_Party]  of  [EN the_Russian_Federation]  ( [EN KPRF] ), which sought to oust  [EN Yeltsin]  from  [EN office]  and return to  [EN power] .
 [EN Yeltsin]  had banned  [EN the_Communist_Party]  of the  [EN Russian_Republic]  for its central  [EN role]  in  [EN the_August_1991_coup]  against the  [EN Gorbachev]   [EN government] .
As a  [EN member]  of the  [EN Politburo]  and  [EN the_Secretariat_of_the]  banned  [EN party] ,  [EN Gennady_Zyuganov]  had worked hard to gain its relegalization.
Despite  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN objections] , the  [EN Constitutional_Court]  cleared the way for the  [EN Russian_communists]  to reemerge as the  [EN KPRF] , headed by  [EN Zyuganov] , in  [EN February_1993] .
 [EN Yeltsin]  temporarily banned the  [EN party]  again in  [EN October_1993]  for its  [EN role]  in  [EN the_Supreme_Soviet's]  just-concluded  [EN attempt]  to overthrow his  [EN administration] .
Beginning in  [EN 1993] ,  [EN Zyuganov]  also led  [EN efforts]  by  [EN KPRF]   [EN deputies]  to impeach  [EN Yeltsin] .
After the  [EN KPRF] 's triumph in the December  [EN 1995_legislative_elections] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  announced that he would run for reelection with the  [EN main]  purpose of safeguarding  [EN Russia]  from a  [EN communist]   [EN restoration] .
Although there was speculation that losing  [EN parties]  in the December  [EN 1995_election]  might choose not to nominate presidential  [EN candidates] , in fact dozens of  [EN citizens]  both prominent and obscure announced their candidacies.
After the  [EN gathering]  and  [EN review]  of  [EN signature]   [EN lists] , the  [EN CEC]  validated eleven  [EN candidates] , one of whom later dropped out.
In the  [EN opinion_polls]  of early  [EN 1996] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  trailed far behind most of the other  [EN candidates] ; his popularity  [EN rating]  was below 10 percent for a prolonged  [EN period] .
However, a last-minute, intense  [EN campaign]  featuring heavy  [EN television]  exposure,  [EN speeches]  throughout  [EN Russia]  promising increased  [EN state]  expenditures for a wide  [EN variety]  of  [EN interest_groups] , and  [EN campaign-sponsored]   [EN concerts]  boosted  [EN Yeltsin]  to a 3 percent  [EN plurality]  over  [EN Zyuganov]  in the first  [EN round] .
The  [EN election_campaign]  was largely sponsored by wealthy  [EN tycoons] , for whom  [EN Yeltsin]  remaining at  [EN power]  was the  [EN key]  to protect their  [EN property]  acquired during the  [EN reforms]  of 1991-1996.
After the first  [EN election]   [EN round] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  took the tactically significant step of appointing  [EN first-round]  presidential  [EN candidate]   [EN Aleksandr_Lebed] , who had placed third behind  [EN Yeltsin]  and  [EN Zyuganov] , as  [EN head]  of  [EN the_Security_Council] .
 [EN Yeltsin]  followed the  [EN appointment]  of  [EN Lebed]  as the  [EN president] 's top  [EN adviser]  on  [EN national_security]  by dismissing several top  [EN hard-line]   [EN members]  of his entourage who were widely blamed for  [EN human_rights_violations]  in  [EN Chechnya]  and other mistakes.
Despite his virtual  [EN disappearance]  from public  [EN view]  for health reasons shortly thereafter,  [EN Yeltsin]  was able to sustain his central  [EN message]  that  [EN Russia]  should move forward rather than return to its  [EN communist_past] .
 [EN Zyuganov]  failed to mount an energetic or convincing  [EN second]   [EN campaign] , and three  [EN weeks]  after the first  [EN phase]  of the  [EN election] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  easily defeated his  [EN opponent] , 54 percent to 40 percent.
Turnout in the first  [EN round]  was high, with about 70 percent of 108.5million voters participating.
Total  [EN turnout]  in the  [EN second]   [EN round]  was nearly the same as in the first  [EN round] .
A contingent of almost 1, 000  [EN international]   [EN observers]  judged the  [EN election]  to be largely  [EN fair]  and democratic, as did the  [EN CEC] .
See below for a summary of the  [EN results]  .
Most  [EN observers]  in  [EN Russia]  and elsewhere concurred that the  [EN election]  boosted  [EN democratization]  in  [EN Russia] , and many asserted that  [EN reforms]  in  [EN Russia]  had become irreversible.
 [EN Yeltsin]  had strengthened the  [EN institution]  of regularly contested  [EN elections]  when he rejected calls by  [EN business]   [EN organizations]  and other  [EN groups]  and some of his own  [EN officials]  to cancel or postpone the balloting because of the threat of  [EN violence] .
The high  [EN turnout]  indicated that voters had confidence that their ballots would count, and the  [EN election]  went forward without  [EN incident] .
The  [EN democratization_process]  also was bolstered by  [EN Yeltsin] 's willingness to change  [EN key]   [EN personnel]  and  [EN policies]  in  [EN response]  to public  [EN protests]  and by his unprecedented series of personal  [EN campaign]   [EN appearances]  throughout  [EN Russia] .
 [EN Government]  ( [EN cabinet] ) edit .
 [EN Main]   [EN article] :  [EN Government]  of  [EN the_Russian_Federation]  .
The  [EN constitution]  prescribes that the  [EN Government]  of  [EN Russia] , which corresponds to the Western  [EN cabinet]   [EN structure] , consist of a  [EN prime_minister]  ( [EN chairman]  of the  [EN Government] ),  [EN deputy_prime_ministers] , and federal  [EN ministers]  and their  [EN ministries_and_departments] .
Within one  [EN week]  of  [EN appointment]  by the  [EN president]  and approval by  [EN the_State_Duma] , the  [EN prime_minister]  must submit to the  [EN president]   [EN nominations]  for all subordinate  [EN Government]   [EN positions] , including  [EN deputy_prime_ministers]  and federal  [EN ministers] .
The  [EN prime_minister]  carries out  [EN administration]  in  [EN line]  with the  [EN constitution]  and  [EN laws]  and presidential decrees.
The  [EN ministries]  of the  [EN Government] , which numbered 24 in mid-1996, execute credit and  [EN monetary_policies]  and  [EN defense] ,  [EN foreign_policy] , and  [EN state_security]   [EN functions] ; ensure the  [EN rule]  of  [EN law]  and respect for human and  [EN civil_rights] ; protect  [EN property] ; and take  [EN measures]  against  [EN crime] .
If the  [EN Government]   [EN issues]  implementing decrees and  [EN directives]  that are at  [EN odds]  with  [EN legislation]  or presidential decrees, the  [EN president]  may rescind them.
The  [EN Government]  formulates the  [EN federal_budget] , submits it to  [EN the_State_Duma] , and  [EN issues]  a  [EN report]  on its  [EN implementation] .
In late  [EN 1994] , the  [EN parliament]  successfully demanded that the  [EN Government]  begin submitting quarterly  [EN reports]  on  [EN budget]  expenditures and adhere to other  [EN guidelines]  on budgetary  [EN matters] , although the  [EN parliament] 's budgetary  [EN powers]  are limited.
If  [EN the_State_Duma]  rejects a  [EN draft]   [EN budget]  from the  [EN Government] , the  [EN budget]  is submitted to a  [EN conciliation]   [EN commission]  including  [EN members]  from both  [EN branches] .
Besides the  [EN ministries] , in  [EN 1996]  the  [EN executive_branch]  included eleven  [EN state]   [EN committees]  and 46  [EN state_services]  and  [EN agencies] , ranging from  [EN the_State_Space_Agency]  (Glavkosmos) to  [EN the_State_Committee_for_Statistics]  ( [EN Goskomstat] ).
There were also myriad  [EN agencies] ,  [EN boards] ,  [EN centers] ,  [EN councils] ,  [EN commissions] , and  [EN committees] .
 [EN Prime_Minister]   [EN Viktor_Chernomyrdin] 's personal staff was reported to number about 2, 000 in  [EN 1995] .
 [EN Chernomyrdin] , who had been appointed  [EN prime_minister]  in late  [EN 1992]  to appease antireform  [EN factions] , established a generally smooth working  [EN relationship]  with  [EN Yeltsin] .
 [EN Chernomyrdin]  proved adept at conciliating hostile domestic  [EN factions]  and at presenting a positive  [EN image]  of  [EN Russia]  in negotiations with other  [EN nations] .
However, as  [EN Yeltsin] 's standing with  [EN public_opinion]  plummeted in  [EN 1995] ,  [EN Chernomyrdin]  became one of many  [EN Government]   [EN officials]  who received public blame from the  [EN president]  for  [EN failures]  in the  [EN Yeltsin]   [EN administration] .
As part of his  [EN presidential_campaign] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  threatened to replace the Chernomyrdin Government if it failed to address pressing  [EN social_welfare]   [EN problems]  in  [EN Russia] .
After the mid-1996  [EN presidential_election] , however,  [EN Yeltsin]  announced that he would nominate  [EN Chernomyrdin]  to head the new  [EN Government] .

 [EN Legislative_branch]  edit .
 [EN Parliament]  edit .
The  [EN 616-member]   [EN parliament] , termed  [EN the_Federal_Assembly] , consists of two  [EN houses] , the  [EN 450-member]   [EN State_Duma]  (the  [EN lower_house] ) and the  [EN 166-member]   [EN Federation_Council]  (the  [EN upper_house] ).
 [EN Russia] 's  [EN legislative_body]  was established by the  [EN constitution]  approved in the December  [EN 1993_referendum] .
The  [EN first_elections]  to  [EN the_Federal_Assembly]  were held at the same timeaa  [EN procedure]  criticized by some  [EN Russians]  as indicative of  [EN Yeltsin] 's lack of respect for constitutional niceties.
Under the  [EN constitution] , the  [EN deputies]  elected in  [EN December_1993]  were termed "transitional" because they were to serve only a two-year term.
In  [EN April_1994] ,  [EN legislators] ,  [EN Government]   [EN officials] , and many prominent  [EN businesspeople]  and religious  [EN leaders]  signed a "Civic  [EN Accord] " proposed by  [EN Yeltsin] , pledging during the two-year " [EN transition]   [EN period] " to refrain from  [EN violence] , calls for early presidential or  [EN legislative_elections] , and attempts to amend the  [EN constitution] .
This accord, and memories of the violent  [EN confrontation]  of the previous  [EN parliament]  with  [EN Government]   [EN forces] , had some effect in softening  [EN political_rhetoric]  during the next two  [EN years] .
The first  [EN legislative_elections]  under the  [EN new_constitution]  included a few  [EN irregularities] .
The  [EN republics]  of  [EN Tatarstan]  and  [EN Chechnya]  and  [EN Chelyabinsk_Oblast]  boycotted the voting; this  [EN action] , along with other discrepancies, resulted in the  [EN election]  of only 170  [EN members]  to  [EN the_Federation_Council] .
However, by mid-1994 all  [EN seats]  were filled except those of  [EN Chechnya] , which continued to proclaim its  [EN independence] .
All federal  [EN jurisdictions]  participated in the December  [EN 1995_legislative_elections] , although the fairness of voting in  [EN Chechnya]  was compromised by the  [EN ongoing_conflict]  there.
 [EN The_Federal_Assembly]  is prescribed as a permanently functioning  [EN body] , meaning that it is in continuous session except for a regular break between the  [EN spring]  and fall sessions.
This working  [EN schedule]  distinguishes the new  [EN parliament]  from  [EN Soviet-era]  " [EN rubber-stamp] "  [EN legislative_bodies] , which met only a few  [EN days]  each year.
The  [EN new_constitution]  also directs that the two  [EN houses]  meet separately in sessions  [EN open]  to the public, although  [EN joint]   [EN meetings]  are held for important  [EN speeches]  by the  [EN president]  or foreign  [EN leaders] .
 [EN Deputies]  of  [EN the_State_Duma]  work full-time on their  [EN legislative]   [EN duties] ; they are not allowed to serve simultaneously in  [EN local_legislatures]  or hold  [EN Government]   [EN positions] .
A transitional  [EN clause]  in the  [EN constitution] , however, allowed  [EN deputies]  elected in  [EN December_1993]  to retain their  [EN Government]  employment, a provision that allowed many  [EN officials]  of the  [EN Yeltsin]   [EN administration]  to serve in the  [EN parliament] .
After the December  [EN 1995_legislative_elections] , nineteen  [EN Government]   [EN officials]  were forced to resign their  [EN offices]  in  [EN order]  to take up their  [EN legislative]   [EN duties] .
Despite its "transitional" nature,  [EN the_Federal_Assembly]  of  [EN 1994-95]  approved about 500  [EN pieces]  of  [EN legislation]  in two  [EN years] .
When the new  [EN parliament]  convened in January  [EN 1996] ,  [EN deputies]  were provided with a catalog of these  [EN laws]  and were directed to work in their assigned  [EN committees]  to fill gaps in existing  [EN legislation]  as well as to draft new  [EN laws] .
A major accomplishment of the  [EN 1994-95]   [EN legislative]  sessions was passage of the first two  [EN parts]  of a new  [EN civil_code] , desperately needed to update antiquated Soviet-era provisions.
The new  [EN code]  included provisions on  [EN contract]  obligations, rents,  [EN insurance] , loans and credit,  [EN partnership] , and  [EN trusteeship] , as well as other legal  [EN standards]  essential to support the creation of a  [EN market_economy] .
Work on several  [EN bills]  that had been in  [EN committee]  or in  [EN floor]   [EN debate]  in the  [EN previous_legislature]  resumed in the new  [EN body] .
Similarly, several  [EN bills]  that  [EN Yeltsin]  had vetoed were taken up again by the new  [EN legislature] .
 [EN Structure]  of  [EN the_Federal_Assembly]  edit .
The  [EN composition]  of  [EN the_Federation_Council]  was a  [EN matter]  of  [EN debate]  until shortly before the  [EN 2000_elections] .
The  [EN legislation]  that emerged in December  [EN 1995]   [EN over]   [EN Federation_Council]   [EN objections]  clarified the  [EN constitution] 's  [EN language]  on the  [EN subject]  by providing  [EN ex_officio]   [EN council]   [EN seats]  to the  [EN heads]  of  [EN local_legislatures]  and  [EN administrations]  in each of the eighty-nine  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions] , hence a total of 178  [EN seats] .
As composed in  [EN 1996] ,  [EN the_Federation_Council]  included about fifty  [EN chief]   [EN executives]  of  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions]  who had been appointed to their  [EN posts]  by  [EN Yeltsin]  during  [EN 1991-92] , then won popular  [EN election]  directly to the  [EN body]  in  [EN December_1993] .
But the  [EN law]  of  [EN 1995]  provided for popular  [EN elections]  of  [EN chief]   [EN executives]  in all  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions] , including those still governed by presidential appointees.
The  [EN individuals]  chosen in those  [EN elections]  then would assume  [EN ex_officio]   [EN seats]  in  [EN the_Federation_Council] .
Each  [EN house]  elects a  [EN chairman]  to control the internal  [EN procedures]  of the  [EN house] .
The  [EN houses]  also form Parliamentary  [EN committees]  and  [EN commissions]  to deal with particular  [EN types]  of  [EN issues] .
Unlike  [EN committees]  and  [EN commissions]  in previous  [EN Russian]  and  [EN Soviet]   [EN parliaments] , those operating under the  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution]  have significant responsibilities in devising  [EN legislation]  and conducting oversight.
They prepare and evaluate  [EN draft]   [EN laws] ,  [EN report]  on  [EN draft]   [EN laws]  to their  [EN houses] , conduct  [EN hearings] , and oversee  [EN implementation]  of the  [EN laws] .
As of early  [EN 1996] , there were  [EN twenty-eight]   [EN committees]  and several  [EN ad_hoc]   [EN commissions]  in  [EN the_State_Duma] , and twelve  [EN committees]  and two  [EN commissions]  in  [EN the_Federation_Council] .
 [EN The_Federation_Council]  has established fewer  [EN committees]  because of the part-time status of its  [EN members] , who also hold political  [EN office]  in the  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions] .
In  [EN 1996]  most of the  [EN committees]  in both  [EN houses]  were retained in basic  [EN form]  from the previous  [EN parliament] .
According to internal  [EN procedure] , no  [EN deputy]  may sit on more than one  [EN committee] .
By  [EN 1996]  many  [EN State_Duma]   [EN committees]  had established  [EN subcommittees] .
 [EN Committee]   [EN positions]  are allocated when new  [EN parliaments]  are seated.
The  [EN general]   [EN policy]  calls for allocation of  [EN committee_chairmanships]  and memberships among  [EN parties]  and  [EN factions]  roughly in proportion to the size of their  [EN representation] .
In  [EN 1994] , however,  [EN Vladimir_Zhirinovsky's]   [EN Liberal_Democratic_Party_of_Russia]  ( [EN Liberal'no-demokraticheskaya]  partiya RossiiaLDPR), which had won the  [EN second]  largest number of  [EN seats]  in the recent  [EN election] , was denied all but one  [EN key]  chairmanship, that of  [EN the_State_Duma's_Committee]  on  [EN Geopolitics] .

 [EN Legislative_Powers]  edit .
The  [EN two_chambers]  of  [EN the_Federal_Assembly]  possess different  [EN powers]  and responsibilities, with  [EN the_State_Duma]  the more powerful.
 [EN The_Federation_Council] , as its name and  [EN composition]  implies, deals primarily with  [EN issues]  of concern to the  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions] , such as adjustments to internal  [EN borders]  and decrees of the  [EN president]  establishing  [EN martial_law]  or  [EN states]  of  [EN emergency] .
As the  [EN upper_chamber] , it also has responsibilities in confirming and removing the  [EN procurator]   [EN general]  and confirming  [EN justices]  of  [EN the_Constitutional_Court] ,  [EN the_Supreme_Court] , and  [EN the_Superior_Court_of_Arbitration] , upon the  [EN recommendation]  of the  [EN president] .
 [EN The_Federation_Council]  also is entrusted with the  [EN final]   [EN decision]  if  [EN the_State_Duma]  recommends removing the  [EN president]  from  [EN office] .
The  [EN constitution]  also directs that  [EN the_Federation_Council]  examine  [EN bills]  passed by the  [EN lower_chamber]  dealing with budgetary,  [EN tax] , and other fiscal  [EN measures] , as well as  [EN issues]  dealing with  [EN war]  and peace and with  [EN treaty]   [EN ratification] .
In the consideration and disposition of most  [EN legislative]   [EN matters] , however,  [EN the_Federation_Council]  has less  [EN power]  than  [EN the_State_Duma] .
All  [EN bills] , even those proposed by  [EN the_Federation_Council] , must first be considered by  [EN the_State_Duma] .
If  [EN the_Federation_Council]  rejects a  [EN bill]  passed by  [EN the_State_Duma] , the  [EN two_chambers]  may form a  [EN conciliation]   [EN commission]  to work out a compromise  [EN version]  of the  [EN legislation] .
 [EN The_State_Duma]  then votes on the compromise  [EN bill] .
If  [EN the_State_Duma]   [EN objects]  to the proposals of the  [EN upper_chamber]  in the  [EN conciliation]   [EN process] , it may vote by a  [EN two-thirds_majority]  to send its  [EN version]  to the  [EN president]  for  [EN signature] .
The part-time  [EN character]  of  [EN the_Federation_Council's]  work, its less developed  [EN committee]   [EN structure] , and its lesser  [EN powers]  vis-A-vis  [EN the_State_Duma]  make it more a consultative and reviewing  [EN body]  than a law-making chamber.
Because  [EN the_Federation_Council]  initially included many regional  [EN administrators]  appointed by  [EN Yeltsin] , that  [EN body]  often supported the  [EN president]  and objected to  [EN bills]  approved by  [EN the_State_Duma] , which had more  [EN anti-Yeltsin]   [EN deputies] .
The  [EN power]  of the  [EN upper_house]  to consider  [EN bills]  passed by the  [EN lower_chamber]  resulted in its disapproval of about one-half of such  [EN bills] , necessitating  [EN concessions]  by  [EN the_State_Duma]  or votes to override upper-chamber  [EN objections] .
In  [EN February_1996] , the  [EN heads]  of the  [EN two_chambers]  pledged to try to break this  [EN habit] , but wrangling appeared to intensify in the  [EN months]  that followed.
 [EN The_State_Duma]  confirms the  [EN appointment]  of the  [EN prime_minister] , although it does not have the  [EN power]  to confirm  [EN Government]   [EN ministers] .
The  [EN power]  to confirm or reject the  [EN prime_minister]  is severely limited.
According to the  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution] ,  [EN the_State_Duma]  must decide within one  [EN week]  to confirm or reject a  [EN candidate]  once the  [EN president]  has placed that  [EN person] 's name in  [EN nomination] .
If it rejects three  [EN candidates] , the  [EN president]  is empowered to appoint a  [EN prime_minister] , dissolve the  [EN parliament] , and  [EN schedule]   [EN new_legislative_elections] .
 [EN The_State_Duma's]   [EN power]  to force the resignation of the  [EN Government]  also is severely limited.
It may express a vote of no-confidence in the  [EN Government]  by a  [EN majority_vote]  of all  [EN members]  of  [EN the_State_Duma] , but the  [EN president]  is allowed to disregard this vote.
If, however,  [EN the_State_Duma]  repeats the  [EN no-confidence_vote]  within three  [EN months] , the  [EN president]  may dismiss the  [EN Government] .
But the likelihood of a  [EN second]   [EN no-confidence_vote]  is virtually precluded by the constitutional provision allowing the  [EN president]  to dissolve  [EN the_State_Duma]  rather than the  [EN Government]  in such a situation.
The  [EN Government] 's  [EN position]  is further buttressed by another constitutional provision that allows the  [EN Government]  at any time to demand a vote of confidence from  [EN the_State_Duma] ; refusal is  [EN grounds]  for the  [EN president]  to dissolve the  [EN Duma] .
The  [EN legislative]   [EN process]  edit .
The  [EN legislative]   [EN process]  1 in  [EN Russia]  includes three  [EN hearings]  in  [EN the_State_Duma] , then approvals by  [EN the_Federation_Council] , the  [EN upper_house]  and  [EN sign]  into  [EN law]  by the  [EN President] .
 [EN Draft]   [EN laws]  may originate in either  [EN legislative_chamber] , or they may be submitted by the  [EN president] , the  [EN Government] ,  [EN local_legislatures]  and  [EN the_Supreme_Court] ,  [EN the_Constitutional_Court] , or  [EN the_Superior_Court_of_Arbitration]  within their respective competences.
 [EN Draft]   [EN laws]  are first considered in  [EN the_State_Duma] .
Upon adoption by a majority of the full  [EN State_Duma]  membership, a  [EN draft]   [EN law]  is considered by  [EN the_Federation_Council] , which has fourteen  [EN days]  to place the  [EN bill]  on its  [EN calendar] .
 [EN Conciliation]   [EN commissions]  are the prescribed  [EN procedure]  to work out  [EN differences]  in  [EN bills]  considered by both  [EN chambers] .
A constitutional provision dictating that  [EN draft]   [EN laws]  dealing with revenues and expenditures may be considered "only when the  [EN Government] 's findings are known" substantially limits  [EN the_Federal_Assembly's]   [EN control]  of  [EN state]   [EN finances] .
However, the  [EN legislature]  may alter  [EN finance]   [EN legislation]  submitted by the  [EN Government]  at a later time, a  [EN power]  that provides a  [EN degree]  of traditional  [EN legislative]   [EN control]  over the purse.
The  [EN two_chambers]  of the  [EN legislature]  also have the  [EN power]  to override a  [EN presidential_veto]  of  [EN legislation] .
The  [EN constitution]  requires at least a  [EN two-thirds_vote]  of the total number of  [EN members]  of both  [EN chambers] .
Judicial  [EN branch]  edit .
 [EN Main_article:_Judiciary_of_Russia_The_VIII_All-Russian_Congress_of_Judges]  in December  [EN 2012] .
.
The  [EN Judiciary]  of  [EN Russia]  is defined under the  [EN Constitution]  and  [EN law]  of  [EN Russia]  with a  [EN hierarchical]   [EN structure]  with  [EN the_Constitutional_Court] ,  [EN Supreme_Court] , and  [EN Supreme_Court]  of  [EN Arbitration]  at the  [EN apex] .
The  [EN district_courts]  are the  [EN primary]   [EN criminal_trial]   [EN courts] , and the regional  [EN courts]  are the  [EN primary]   [EN appellate_courts] .
The  [EN judiciary]  is governed by  [EN the_All-Russian_Congress_of_Judges]  and its  [EN Council_of_Judges] , and its management is aided by  [EN the_Judicial_Department_of_the_Supreme_Court] ,  [EN the_Judicial_Qualification_Collegia] ,  [EN the_Ministry_of_Justice] , and the various  [EN courts] '  [EN chairpersons] .
There are many  [EN officers]  of the  [EN court] , including  [EN jurors] , but the  [EN Prosecutor_General]  remains the most powerful  [EN component]  of the  [EN Russian_judicial_system] .
Many  [EN judges]  appointed by the regimes of  [EN Leonid_Brezhnev]  (in  [EN office]  1964-82) and  [EN Yuri_Andropov]  (in  [EN office]  1982-84) remained in  [EN place]  in the  [EN mid-1990s] .
Such  [EN arbiters]  were trained in " [EN socialist_law] " and had become accustomed to basing their verdicts on  [EN telephone]  calls from local  [EN CPSU]   [EN bosses]  rather than on the legal merits of  [EN cases] .
For  [EN court]   [EN infrastructure]  and financial support,  [EN judges]  must depend on  [EN the_Ministry_of_Justice] , and for housing they must depend on  [EN local_authorities]  in the  [EN jurisdiction]  where they sit.
In  [EN 1995]  the average salary for a  [EN judge]  was  [EN US$160]  per  [EN month] , substantially less than the earnings associated with more menial  [EN positions]  in  [EN Russian_society] .
These circumstances, combined with  [EN irregularities]  in the  [EN appointment]   [EN process]  and the continued strong  [EN position]  of the  [EN procurators] , deprived  [EN judges]  in the lower  [EN jurisdictions]  of independent authority.
The  [EN Constitutional_Court_of_Russia]   [EN building] , built in  [EN 1834] .
.
Numerous  [EN matters]  which are dealt with by administrative authority in  [EN European]   [EN countries]  remain  [EN subject]  to political influence in  [EN Russia] .
The  [EN Constitutional_Court_of_Russia]  was reconvened in  [EN March_1995]  following its  [EN suspension]  by  [EN President_Yeltsin]  during the  [EN October_1993_constitutional_crisis] .
The  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution]  empowers the  [EN court]  to  [EN arbitrate]   [EN disputes]  between the  [EN executive]  and  [EN legislative]   [EN branches]  and between  [EN Moscow]  and the regional and local  [EN governments] .
The  [EN court]  also is authorized to rule on  [EN violations]  of  [EN constitutional_rights] , to examine  [EN appeals]  from various  [EN bodies] , and to participate in  [EN impeachment]  proceedings against the  [EN president] .
The  [EN July_1994]   [EN Law]  on  [EN the_Constitutional_Court]  prohibits the  [EN court]  from examining  [EN cases]  on its own  [EN initiative]  and limits the scope of  [EN issues]  the  [EN court]  can hear.
 [EN The_State_Duma]  passed a  [EN Criminal_Procedure_Code]  and other  [EN judicial_reforms]  during its  [EN 2001]  session.
These  [EN reforms]  help make the  [EN Russian_judicial_system]  more compatible with its  [EN Western]   [EN counterparts]  and are seen by most as an accomplishment in  [EN human_rights] .
The  [EN reforms]  have reintroduced  [EN jury_trials]  in certain  [EN criminal]   [EN cases]  and created a more  [EN adversarial_system]  of  [EN criminal_trials]  that protect the  [EN rights]  of  [EN defendants]  more adequately.
In  [EN 2002] , the  [EN introduction]  of the new  [EN code]  led to significant reductions in time spent in detention for new  [EN detainees] , and the number of  [EN suspects]  placed in pretrial detention declined by 30Another significant advance in the new  [EN Code]  is the  [EN transfer]  from the  [EN Procuracy]  to the  [EN courts]  of the authority to issue search and  [EN arrest_warrants] .
Local and Regional  [EN Government]  edit .
In the  [EN Soviet_period] , some of  [EN Russia] 's approximately 100 nationalities were granted their own ethnic  [EN enclaves] , to which varying formal federal  [EN rights]  were attached.
Other smaller or more dispersed nationalities did not receive such recognition.
In most of these  [EN enclaves] ,  [EN ethnic_Russians]  constituted a majority of the  [EN population] , although the titular nationalities usually enjoyed disproportionate  [EN representation]  in  [EN local_government]   [EN bodies] .
 [EN Relations]  between the  [EN central_government]  and the subordinate  [EN jurisdictions] , and among those  [EN jurisdictions] , became a political  [EN issue]  in the 1990s.
 [EN The_Russian_Federation]  has made few  [EN changes]  in the  [EN Soviet]   [EN pattern]  of regional  [EN jurisdictions] .
The  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution]  establishes a  [EN federal_government]  and enumerates eighty-nine  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions] , including twenty-one ethnic  [EN enclaves]  with the status of  [EN republics] .
There are ten  [EN autonomous_regions] , or okruga (sing.  [EN okrug]  ), and  [EN the_Jewish_Autonomous_Oblast]  ( [EN Yevreyskaya]  avtonomnaya  [EN oblast'] , also known as  [EN Birobidzhan] ).
Besides the ethnically identified  [EN jurisdictions] , there are six  [EN territories]  (kraya; sing.  [EN kray]  ) and  [EN forty-nine]   [EN oblasts]  ( [EN provinces] ).
The  [EN cities]  of  [EN Moscow]  and  [EN St._Petersburg]  are independent of surrounding  [EN jurisdictions] ; termed " [EN cities]  of federal significance, " they have the same status as the  [EN oblasts] .
The ten  [EN autonomous_regions]  and  [EN Birobidzhan]  are part of larger  [EN jurisdictions] , either an  [EN oblast]  or a  [EN territory] .
As the  [EN power]  and influence of the  [EN central_government]  have become diluted,  [EN governors]  and  [EN mayors]  have become the only relevant  [EN government]   [EN authorities]  in many  [EN jurisdictions] .
 [EN The_Federation_Treaty_and_Regional_Power]  edit .
 [EN Russian_President]   [EN Putin]  with local  [EN residents]  in  [EN Lensk] ,  [EN Sakha_Republic]  .
 [EN The_Federation_Treaty]  was signed in  [EN March_1992]  by  [EN President_Yeltsin]  and most  [EN leaders]  of the  [EN autonomous_republics]  and other ethnic and geographical subunits.
The  [EN treaty]  consisted of three separate  [EN documents] , each pertaining to one  [EN type]  of regional  [EN jurisdiction] .
It outlined  [EN powers]  reserved for the  [EN central_government] , shared  [EN powers] , and  [EN residual_powers]  to be exercised primarily by the subunits.
Because  [EN Russia] 's  [EN new_constitution]  remained in  [EN dispute]  in  [EN the_Federal_Assembly]  at the time of  [EN ratification] ,  [EN the_Federation_Treaty]  and provisions based on the  [EN treaty]  were incorporated as  [EN amendments]  to the  [EN 1978_constitution] .
A series of new  [EN conditions]  were established by the  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution]  and by  [EN bilateral]   [EN agreements] .
Local  [EN Jurisdictions]  under the  [EN Constitution]  edit .
The  [EN constitution]  of  [EN 1993]  resolved many of the ambiguities and contradictions concerning the  [EN degree]  of  [EN decentralization]  under the much-amended  [EN 1978_constitution]  of the  [EN Russian_Republic] ; most such  [EN solutions]  favored the concentration of  [EN power]  in the  [EN central_government] .
When the  [EN constitution]  was ratified,  [EN the_Federation_Treaty]  was demoted to the status of a subconstitutional  [EN document] .
A transitional provision of the  [EN constitution]  provided that in  [EN case]  of discrepancies between the  [EN federal_constitution]  and  [EN the_Federation_Treaty] , or between the  [EN constitution]  and other  [EN treaties]  involving a  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdiction] , all other  [EN documents]  would defer to the  [EN constitution] .
The  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution]  presents a daunting  [EN list]  of  [EN powers]  reserved to the  [EN center] .
 [EN Powers]  shared jointly between the federal and  [EN local_authorities]  are less numerous.
Regional  [EN jurisdictions]  are only allocated  [EN powers]  not specifically reserved to the  [EN federal_government]  or exercised jointly.
Those  [EN powers]  include managing  [EN municipal_property] , establishing and executing regional  [EN budgets] , establishing and collecting regional  [EN taxes] , and maintaining  [EN law_and_order] .
Some of the  [EN boundaries]  between  [EN joint]  and exclusively federal  [EN powers]  are vaguely prescribed; presumably they would become clearer through the give and take of federal  [EN practice]  or through  [EN adjudication] , as has occurred in other  [EN federal_systems] .
Meanwhile,  [EN bilateral]   [EN power-sharing]   [EN treaties]  between the  [EN central_government]  and the subunits have become an important  [EN means]  of clarifying the  [EN boundaries]  of shared  [EN powers] .
Many  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions]  have  [EN their_own_constitutions] , however, and often those  [EN documents]  allocate  [EN powers]  to the  [EN jurisdiction]  inconsistent with provisions of the  [EN federal_constitution] .
As of  [EN 1996] , no  [EN process]  had been devised for  [EN adjudication]  of such  [EN conflicts] .
Under the  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution] , the  [EN republics] ,  [EN territories] ,  [EN oblasts] ,  [EN autonomous_oblast] ,  [EN autonomous_regions] , and  [EN cities]  of federal  [EN designation]  are held to be " [EN equal]  in their  [EN relations]  with the  [EN federal_agencies]  of  [EN state]   [EN power] "; this  [EN language]  represents an  [EN attempt]  to end the  [EN complaints]  of the nonrepublic  [EN jurisdictions]  about their inferior status.
In keeping with this new  [EN equality] ,  [EN republics]  no longer receive the  [EN epithet]  "sovereign, " as they did in the  [EN 1978_constitution] .
 [EN Equal]   [EN representation]  in  [EN the_Federation_Council]  for all eighty-nine  [EN jurisdictions]  furthers the  [EN equalization]   [EN process]  by providing them meaningful input into  [EN legislative]   [EN activities] , particularly those of  [EN special]  local concern.
However,  [EN Federation_Council]   [EN officials]  have criticized  [EN the_State_Duma]  for failing to represent regional  [EN interests]  adequately.
In mid-1995  [EN Vladimir_Shumeyko] , then  [EN speaker]  of  [EN the_Federation_Council] , criticized the  [EN current]   [EN electoral_system] 's  [EN party-list]  provision for allowing some  [EN parts]  of  [EN Russia]  to receive disproportionate  [EN representation]  in the  [EN lower_house] .
(In the  [EN 1995_elections] ,  [EN Moscow_Oblast]  received nearly 38 percent of  [EN the_State_Duma's]   [EN seats]  based on the concentration of  [EN party-list]   [EN candidates]  in the  [EN national]   [EN capital] .)
 [EN Shumeyko]  contended that such misallocation fed potentially dangerous popular discontent with the  [EN parliament]  and  [EN politicians] .
Despite constitutional  [EN language]  equalizing the regional  [EN jurisdictions]  in their  [EN relations]  with the  [EN center] , vestiges of  [EN Soviet-era]  multitiered  [EN federalism]  remain in a number of provisions, including those allowing for the use of  [EN non-Russian_languages]  in the  [EN republics]  but not in other  [EN jurisdictions] , and in the  [EN definitions]  of the five  [EN categories]  of  [EN subunit] .
On most details of the  [EN federal_system] , the  [EN constitution]  is vague, and clarifying  [EN legislation]  had not been passed by mid-1996.
However, some  [EN analysts]  have pointed out that this  [EN vagueness]  facilitates  [EN resolution]  of  [EN individual]   [EN conflicts]  between the  [EN center]  and the  [EN regions] .
 [EN Power]  Sharing edit .
 [EN Yegor_Borisov] ,  [EN president]  of  [EN the_Sakha_Republic] , a  [EN federal_subject]  of  [EN Russia] .

 [EN Flexibility]  is a goal of the constitutional provision allowing  [EN bilateral_treaties]  or  [EN charters]  between the  [EN central_government]  and the  [EN regions]  on  [EN power]  sharing.
For instance, in the  [EN bilateral_treaty]  signed with the  [EN Russian_government]  in  [EN February_1994] , the  [EN Republic]  of  [EN Tatarstan]  gave up its  [EN claim]  to  [EN sovereignty]  and accepted  [EN Russia] 's taxing authority, in return for  [EN Russia] 's acceptance of  [EN Tatar]   [EN control]  over  [EN oil]  and other  [EN resources]  and the  [EN republic] 's  [EN right]  to sign economic  [EN agreements]  with other  [EN countries] .
This  [EN treaty]  has particular significance because  [EN Tatarstan]  was one of the two  [EN republics]  that did not sign  [EN the_Federation_Treaty]  in  [EN 1992] .
By mid-1996 almost one-third of the federal subunits had concluded  [EN power-sharing]   [EN treaties]  or  [EN charters] .
The first  [EN power-sharing]   [EN charter]  negotiated by the  [EN central_government]  and an  [EN oblast]  was signed in December  [EN 1995]  with  [EN Orenburg_Oblast] .
The  [EN charter]  divided  [EN power]  in the  [EN areas]  of economic and  [EN agricultural_policy] ,  [EN natural_resources] ,  [EN international]  economic  [EN relations]  and  [EN trade] , and  [EN military_industries] .
According to  [EN Prime_Minister]   [EN Chernomyrdin] , the  [EN charter]  gave  [EN Orenburg]  full  [EN power]  over its  [EN budget]  and allowed the  [EN oblast]  to participate in  [EN privatization]   [EN decisions] .
By early  [EN 1996] , similar  [EN charters]  had been signed with  [EN Krasnodar_Territory]  and  [EN Kaliningrad]  and  [EN Sverdlovsk]   [EN oblasts] .
In the summer of  [EN 1996] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  wooed  [EN potential]  regional  [EN supporters]  of his reelection by signing  [EN charters]  with  [EN Perm'] ,  [EN Rostov] ,  [EN Tver'] , and  [EN Leningrad]   [EN oblasts]  and with the  [EN city]  of  [EN St._Petersburg] , among  [EN others] , granting these  [EN regions]   [EN liberal]   [EN tax]   [EN treatment]  and other economic advantages.
By the  [EN mid-1990s] , regional  [EN jurisdictions]  also had become bolder in passing  [EN local_legislation]  to fill gaps in  [EN federation]   [EN statutes]  rather than waiting for  [EN the_Federal_Assembly]  to act.
For  [EN example] ,  [EN Volgograd_Oblast]  passed  [EN laws]  regulating local  [EN pensions] , the issuance of  [EN promissory_notes] , and  [EN credit_unions] .
The  [EN constitution]  upholds regional  [EN legislative]  authority to pass  [EN laws]  that accord with the  [EN constitution]  and existing federal  [EN laws] .
Presidential  [EN Power]  in the  [EN Regions]  edit .
The  [EN president]  retains the  [EN power]  to appoint and remove presidential  [EN representatives] , who act as direct emissaries to the  [EN jurisdictions]  in overseeing local  [EN administrations] '  [EN implementation]  of presidential  [EN policies] .
The  [EN power]  to appoint these overseers was granted by  [EN the_Russian_Supreme_Soviet]  to  [EN Yeltsin]  in late  [EN 1991] .
The  [EN parliament]  attempted several  [EN times]  during  [EN 1992-93]  to repeal or curtail the  [EN activities]  of these appointees, whose  [EN powers]  are only alluded to in the  [EN constitution] .
The presence of  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN representatives]  helped bring out the local vote on his behalf in the  [EN 1996_presidential_election] .
The  [EN governments]  of the  [EN republics]  include a  [EN president]  or  [EN prime_minister]  (or both) and a  [EN regional_council]  or  [EN legislature] .
The  [EN chief]   [EN executives]  of lower  [EN jurisdictions]  are called  [EN governors]  or administrative  [EN heads] .
Generally, in  [EN jurisdictions]  other than  [EN republics]  the  [EN executive]   [EN branches]  have been more sympathetic to the  [EN central_government] , and the  [EN legislatures]  (called  [EN soviets]  until late  [EN 1993] , then called  [EN dumas]  or  [EN assemblies] ) have been the  [EN center]  of whatever  [EN separatist_sentiment]  exists.
Under the  [EN power]  given him in  [EN 1991]  to appoint the  [EN chief]   [EN executives]  of  [EN territories] ,  [EN oblasts] ,  [EN autonomous_regions] , and the  [EN autonomous_oblast] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  had appointed virtually all of the sixty-six  [EN leaders]  of those  [EN jurisdictions] .
By contrast,  [EN republic]   [EN presidents]  have been popularly elected since  [EN 1992] .
Some of  [EN Yeltsin] 's appointees have encountered strong opposition from their  [EN legislatures] ; in  [EN 1992]  and  [EN 1993] , in some  [EN cases]  votes of no-confidence brought about popular  [EN elections]  for the  [EN position]  of  [EN chief_executive] .
After the  [EN Moscow]   [EN confrontation]  of  [EN October_1993] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  sought to bolster his regional support by dissolving the  [EN legislatures]  of all federal subunits except the  [EN republics]  (which were advised to "reform" their  [EN political_systems] ).
Accordingly, in  [EN 1994_elections]  were held in all the  [EN jurisdictions]  whose  [EN legislatures]  had been dismissed.
In some  [EN cases] , that  [EN process]  placed  [EN local_executives]  at the  [EN head]  of  [EN legislative_bodies] , eliminating  [EN checks_and_balances]  between the  [EN branches]  at the regional level.
 [EN Election]   [EN results]  in the  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions]  held great significance for the  [EN Yeltsin]   [EN administration]  because the  [EN winners]  would fill the  [EN ex_officio]   [EN seats]  in  [EN the_Federation_Council] , which until  [EN 1996]  was a reliable  [EN bastion]  of support.
The  [EN election]  of large  [EN numbers]  of opposition  [EN candidates]  would end  [EN the_Federation_Council's]  usefulness as a  [EN balance]  against the  [EN anti-Yeltsin_State_Duma]  and further impede  [EN Yeltsin] 's agenda.
In  [EN 1995]  some  [EN regions]  held  [EN gubernatorial_elections]  to fill the administrative  [EN posts]  originally granted to  [EN Yeltsin]  appointees in  [EN 1991] .
Faced with an escalating number of  [EN requests]  for such  [EN elections] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  decreed  [EN December_1996]  as the  [EN date]  for most  [EN gubernatorial]  and  [EN republic]   [EN presidential_elections] .
This  [EN date]  was confirmed by a 19  [EN 95_Federation_Council]   [EN law] .
The  [EN decree]  also set  [EN subnational]   [EN legislative_elections]  for June or  [EN December_1997] .
(In  [EN July_1996] ,  [EN the_State_Duma]  advanced these  [EN elections]  to late  [EN 1996] .)
 [EN Observers]  noted that by calling for most of these  [EN elections]  to take  [EN place]  after the  [EN presidential_election] ,  [EN Yeltsin]  prevented unfavorable outcomes from possibly reducing his reelection chancesaeven though  [EN voter_apathy]  after the  [EN presidential_election]  had the  [EN potential]  to help opposition  [EN candidates] .

However,  [EN President_Putin]  passed a  [EN law]  that all  [EN seats]  are to be elected by  [EN proportional_representation]  ( with at least 7f the vote to qualify for  [EN seats] ) to take effect in the  [EN December_2007_elections] .
By doing this  [EN Putin]  has eliminated  [EN independents]  and made it more difficult for small  [EN parties]  to be elected to the  [EN Duma] .
 [EN Executive-legislative]   [EN power]  struggles, 1993-96 edit .
 [EN Main]   [EN article] :  [EN Russian_constitutional_crisis]  of  [EN 1993]  .
Although the  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution]  weakened their standing vis-A-vis the  [EN presidency] , the  [EN parliaments]  elected in  [EN 1993]  and  [EN 1995]  nonetheless used their  [EN powers]  to shape  [EN legislation]  according to their own precepts and to defy  [EN Yeltsin]  on some  [EN issues] .
An early  [EN example]  was the  [EN February_1994]   [EN State_Duma]  vote to grant  [EN amnesty]  to the  [EN leaders]  of the  [EN 1991]   [EN Moscow]   [EN coup] .
 [EN Yeltsin]  vehemently denounced this  [EN action] , although it was within the constitutional purview of  [EN the_State_Duma] .
In  [EN October_1994] , both  [EN legislative]   [EN chambers]  passed a  [EN law]  over  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN veto]  requiring the  [EN Government]  to submit quarterly  [EN reports]  on  [EN budget]  expenditures to  [EN the_State_Duma]  and adhere to other budgetary  [EN guidelines] .
In the most significant  [EN executive-legislative]  clash since  [EN 1993] ,  [EN the_State_Duma]  overwhelmingly voted  [EN no_confidence]  in the  [EN Government]  in  [EN June_1995] .
The vote was triggered by a  [EN Chechen]   [EN rebel]  raid into the neighboring  [EN Russian]   [EN town]  of  [EN Budenovsk] , where the  [EN rebels]  were able to take more than 1, 000  [EN hostages] .
Dissatisfaction with  [EN Yeltsin] 's  [EN economic_reforms]  also was a  [EN factor]  in the vote.
A  [EN second]   [EN motion]  of  [EN no_confidence]  failed to carry in early July.
In  [EN March_1996] ,  [EN the_State_Duma]  again incensed  [EN Yeltsin]  by voting to revoke the  [EN December_1991]   [EN resolution]  of  [EN the_Russian_Supreme_Soviet]  abrogating the  [EN 1922]   [EN treaty]  under which  [EN the_Soviet_Union]  had been founded.
That  [EN resolution]  had prepared the way for  [EN formation]  of the  [EN Commonwealth_of_Independent_States] .
In his  [EN February_1996]   [EN State_of_the_Union_speech,_Yeltsin_commended_the_previous_parliament_for_passing_a_number_of_significant_laws,_and_he_noted_with_relief_the_"] civil"  [EN resolution]  of the  [EN June_1995]  no-confidence  [EN conflict] .
He complained, however, that  [EN the_Federal_Assembly]  had not acted on  [EN issues]  such as the private ownership of  [EN land] , a  [EN tax_code] , and  [EN judicial_reform] .
 [EN Yeltsin]  also was critical of  [EN legislation]  that he had been forced to return to the  [EN parliament]  because it contravened the  [EN constitution]  and existing  [EN law] , and of  [EN legislative_attempts]  to pass fiscal  [EN legislation]  in  [EN violation]  of the constitutional  [EN stricture]  that such  [EN bills]  must be preapproved by the  [EN Government] .
He noted that he would continue to use his  [EN veto_power]  against ill-drafted  [EN bills]  and his  [EN power]  to issue decrees on  [EN issues]  he deemed important, and that such decrees would remain in  [EN force]  until suitable  [EN laws]  were passed.
 [EN The_State_Duma]  passed a  [EN resolution]  in  [EN March_1996]  demanding that  [EN Yeltsin]  refrain from returning  [EN bills]  to the  [EN parliament]  for redrafting, arguing that the  [EN president]  was obligated either to sign  [EN bills]  or to veto them.

In the first half of the 1990s,  [EN observers]  speculated about the possibility that some of the  [EN jurisdictions]  in the  [EN federation]  might emulate the  [EN former_Soviet_republics]  and demand full  [EN independence] .
Several  [EN factors]  militate against such an outcome, however.
 [EN Russia]  is more than 80 percent  [EN ethnic_Russian] , and most of the thirty-two ethnically based  [EN jurisdictions]  are demographically dominated by  [EN ethnic_Russians] , as are all of the  [EN territories]  and  [EN oblasts] .
Many of the  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions]  are in the interior of  [EN Russia] , meaning that they could not break away without joining a bloc of seceding  [EN border]   [EN areas] , and the  [EN economies]  of all such  [EN jurisdictions]  were thoroughly integrated with the  [EN national]   [EN economy]  in the  [EN Soviet_system] .
The  [EN 1993]   [EN constitution]  strengthens the  [EN official]  status of the  [EN central_government]  in relation to the various  [EN regions] , although  [EN Moscow]  has made significant  [EN concessions]  in  [EN bilateral_treaties] .
Finally, most of the  [EN differences]  at the  [EN base]  of  [EN separatist]   [EN movements]  are economic and geographic rather than ethnic.
 [EN Advocates]  of  [EN secession] , who are numerous in several  [EN regions] , generally appear to be in the  [EN minority]  and are unevenly dispersed.
Some  [EN regions]  have even advocated greater  [EN centralization]  on some  [EN matters] .
By  [EN 1996]  most  [EN experts]  believed that the  [EN federation]  would hold together, although probably at the expense of additional  [EN concessions]  of  [EN power]  by the  [EN central_government] .
The  [EN trend]  is not toward  [EN separatism]  so much as the  [EN devolution]  of central  [EN powers]  to the  [EN localities]  on  [EN trade] ,  [EN taxes] , and other  [EN matters] .
Some  [EN experts]  observe that the  [EN Russia] 's ethnically distinct Republics pressing  [EN claims]  for greater  [EN subunit]   [EN rights]  fall into three  [EN groups] .
The first is composed of those  [EN jurisdictions]  most vociferous in pressing ethnic  [EN separatism] , including  [EN Chechnya]  and perhaps other  [EN republics]  of the  [EN North_Caucasus] , and the  [EN Republic]  of  [EN Tuva] .
The  [EN second]   [EN group]  consists of large,  [EN resource-rich]   [EN republics] , including  [EN Karelia] ,  [EN Komi_Republic] , and  [EN Sakha]  ( [EN Yakutia] ).
Their  [EN differences]  with  [EN Moscow]   [EN center]  on  [EN resource]   [EN control]  and  [EN taxes]  rather than demands for outright  [EN independence] .
A third, mixed  [EN group]  consists of  [EN republics]  along  [EN the_Volga_River] , which straddle strategic  [EN water] , rail, and  [EN pipeline]   [EN routes] , possess  [EN resources]  such as  [EN oil] , and include large  [EN numbers]  of  [EN Russia] 's  [EN Muslim]  and  [EN Buddhist]   [EN populations] .
These  [EN republics]  include  [EN Bashkortostan] ,  [EN Kalmykia] ,  [EN Mari_El] ,  [EN Mordovia] ,  [EN Tatarstan] , and  [EN Udmurtia] .
In addition to the  [EN republics] , several other  [EN jurisdictions]  have lobbied for greater  [EN rights] , mainly on questions of  [EN resource]   [EN control]  and  [EN taxation] .
These include  [EN Sverdlovsk_Oblast] , which in  [EN 1993]  proclaimed itself an  [EN autonomous_republic]  as a  [EN protest]  against receiving fewer privileges in  [EN taxation]  and  [EN resource]   [EN control]  than the  [EN republics] , and strategically vital  [EN Primorsky_Krai]  (" [EN Maritime_Territory] ") on the  [EN Pacific_coast] , whose  [EN governor]  in the  [EN mid-1990s] ,  [EN Yevgeniy_Nazdratenko] , defied central economic and political  [EN policies]  on a number of well-publicized  [EN issues] .
Some limited cooperation has occurred among  [EN Russia] 's regional  [EN jurisdictions] , and  [EN experts]  believe there is  [EN potential]  for even greater coordination.
Eight regional cooperation  [EN organizations]  have been established, covering all  [EN subnational]   [EN jurisdictions]  except  [EN Chechnya:]  the  [EN Siberian_Accord_Association] ; the  [EN Central_Russia_Association] ;  [EN the_Northwest_Association] ; the  [EN Black_Earth_Association] ;  [EN the_Cooperation_Association_of_North_Caucasus_Republics] , Territories, and  [EN Oblasts] ; the  [EN Greater_Volga_Association] ;  [EN the_Ural_Regional_Association] ; and  [EN the_Far_East]  and  [EN Baikal_Association] .
 [EN The_Federation_Council]  formally recognized these interjurisdictional  [EN organizations]  in  [EN 1994] .
 [EN Expansion]  of the  [EN organizations] '  [EN activities]  is hampered by economic  [EN inequalities]  among their  [EN members]  and by inadequate interregional  [EN transportation_infrastructure] , but in  [EN 1996]  they began increasing their influence in  [EN Moscow] .
Regional and ethnic  [EN conflicts]  have encouraged proposals to abolish the existing subunits and resurrect the  [EN tsarist-era]   [EN guberniya] , or large  [EN province] , which would incorporate several smaller subunits on the basis of  [EN geography]  and  [EN population]  rather than ethnic considerations.
 [EN Russian]   [EN ultranationalists]  such as  [EN Vladimir_Zhirinovsky]  have been joined in supporting this proposal by some  [EN officials]  of the  [EN national]   [EN Government]  and  [EN oblast]  and  [EN territory]   [EN leaders]  who resent the privileges of the  [EN republics] .
Some have called for these new subunits to be based on the eight interregional economic  [EN associations] .

Other  [EN parties]  retaining  [EN seats]  in  [EN the_State_Duma] , the  [EN lower_house]  of the  [EN legislature] , are the  [EN Communist_Party]  of  [EN the_Russian_Federation] ,  [EN the_Liberal_Democratic_Party]  of  [EN Russia]  and A Just  [EN Russia] .

 [EN Putin]  (who had previously been made  [EN Prime_Minister_of_Russia] , and, following  [EN Yeltsin] 's resignation, acting  [EN president]  of  [EN Russia] ) won in the first  [EN round]  with 53f the vote in what were judged generally  [EN free]  and  [EN fair]   [EN elections] .

However,  [EN pundits]  in  [EN Russia]  believed this not to be due to the  [EN president] 's displeasure with the  [EN government] , but with  [EN Mikhail_Kasyanov]  himself, as the  [EN Russian_constitution]  does not allow the  [EN prime_minister]  to be removed without firing the whole  [EN cabinet] .
